/* This is a penalty that we add whenever a page breaking solution
   is not bad enough to completely discard, but bad enough that
   it is worse than any "proper" solution. For example, if we didn't
   manage to fit systems on the desired number of pages or if there was
   too big for a page.

   This constant is large enough that it dominates any reasonable penalty,
   but small enough that nothing will overflow to infinity (so that we
   can still distinguish bad spacings by the number of BAD_SPACING_PENALTYs
   that they incur.

   BAD_SPACING_PENALTY is for occasions where the spacing is bad.
   TERRIBLE_SPACING_PENALTY is for when we are disregarding a user override
   (for example, we are failing to satisfy min-systems-per-page). These user
   overrides are more important than getting good spacing, so they get a
   larger penalty.
