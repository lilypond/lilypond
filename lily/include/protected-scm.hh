/*
  Mix GUILE GC with C++ ctors and dtors.

  This version is intended to be only used for variables of static
  lifetime (which are not feasible to protect using the per-instance
  mechanism of the smob classes) but possibly varying content.  As a
  result, the protection mechanism being used is the irreversible
  scm_permanent_object.  The destructor (typically called after the
  end of program execution) does not free resources and consequently
  does not require the memory subsystem to be still workable.  A
  working memory subsystem is only required once a non-immediate
  Scheme value is assigned to the variable.  Since creation of a
  non-immediate Scheme value requires a working memory subsystem in
  the first place, this is not really a restriction.

  To avoid accidental creation of temporaries, the copy constructor is
  made unavailable.
