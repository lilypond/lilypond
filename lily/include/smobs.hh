/*
  Smobs are GUILEs mechanism of exporting C(++) objects to the Scheme
  world.  They are documented in the GUILE manual.


  In LilyPond, C++ objects can be placed under the control of GUILE's
  type system and garbage collection mechanism by inheriting from one
  of several Smob base classes.

  There are two types of smob objects.

  1. Simple smobs are intended for simple objects like numbers:
  immutable objects that can be copied without change of meaning.

  To obtain an SCM version of a simple smob, use the member function
  SCM smobbed_copy ().

  Simple smobs are created by deriving from Simple_smob<Classname>.

  A simple smob is only optionally under the reign of the GUILE
  garbage collector: its usual life time is that of a normal C++
  object.  While a smobbed_copy () is fully under control of the
  garbage collector and will have its mark_smob function called during
  garbage collection, an automatic variable of this type will not have
  mark_smob called, but rather have its memory image in the call stack
  scanned for contained non-immediate SCM values.  Anything requiring
  more complex mark_smob behavior is not suitable for a simple smob.

  When you create a smobbed_copy, the _copy_ is fully managed by the
  GUILE memory system.  As a corollary, multiple smobbed_copy calls
  yield multiple GUILE objects generally not eq? to each other.

  2. Complex smobs are objects that have an identity. These objects
  carry this identity in the form of a self_scm () method, which is a
  SCM pointer to the object itself.  Complex smobs are always under
  control of the GUILE memory system.

  The constructor for a complex smob should have 3 steps:

  * initialize all SCM members to an immediate value (like SCM_EOL)

  * call smobify_self ()

  * initialize SCM members

  For example,

  Complex_smob::Complex_smob : public Smob<Complex_smob> () {
  scm_member_ = SCM_EOL;
  smobify_self ();
  scm_member_ = <..what you want to store..>
  }

  after construction, the self_scm () field of a complex smob is
  protected from Garbage Collection.  This protection should be
  removed once the object is put into another (reachable) Scheme data
  structure, i.e.

  Complex_smob *p = new Complex_smob;
  list = scm_cons (p->self_scm (), list);
  p->unprotect ();

  Since unprotect returns the SCM object itself, this particular case
  can be written as

  Complex_smob *p = new Complex_smob;
  list = scm_cons (p->unprotect (), list);

  Complex smobs are created by deriving from Smob<Classname>.

  However, this is not sufficient when classes with their own
  protectable elements are derived from the Complex base class.  This
  is because initialization order is a tricky thing: once a base class
  calls smobify_self () in its constructor, further allocations during
  construction of base class and derived classes might lead to
  mark_smob calls on the object under construction.  When those call a
  virtual function like derived_mark, the virtual function
  corresponding to the incompletely initialized object of derived
  class type is likely to be called.

  The order of initialization of an object consists in calling the
  constructors of virtual base classes, then of non-virtual base
  classes, then initializing all data members.

  As a result, the constructor of a derived class comes too late for
  initialization of data members that may be accessed in the
  derived_mark kind of functions.

  Such data members are consequently moved into Preinit_* classes
  which come before the smobifying base class in derivation order and
  construct the contained data members in a state suitable for
  derived_mark calls.


  CALLING INTERFACE

  Common global functions for accessing C++ smob objects:

  - unsmob<T> (SCM x) - unpack X and return a pointer to the C++ object,
    or 0 if it has the wrong type.

  IMPLEMENTATION

  For implementating a class, the following public members can be
  provided in the top class itself:

  - SCM equal_p (SCM a, SCM b) - compare A and B. Returns a Scheme
    boolean.  If the class does not define this function, equal? will
    be equivalent to eq?.  The function will only be called when both
    objects are of the respective type and not eq? to each other.

  - mark_smob () function, that calls scm_gc_mark () on all Scheme
    objects in the class.  If the class does not define this function,
    it must not contain non-immediate Scheme values.

  - a print_smob () function, that displays a representation for
    debugging purposes.  If the class does not define this function,
    the output will be #<Classname> when printing.

  - a static const * const type_p_name_ std::string set to something like
    "ly:grob?".  When provided, an accordingly named function for
    checking for the given smob type will be available in Scheme.
