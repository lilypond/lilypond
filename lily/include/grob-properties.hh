// This module is concerned with managing grob-properties (more
// exactly, grob property templates, as they are not yet part of a
// grob) inside of context properties, in a context-hierarchical
// manner, with one stack for properties and subproperties per
// context.

#include "lily-proto.hh"

// Several algorithms on Grob_properties need self-identifying
// information to work properly, but there is no point in storing them
// in the Grob_properties data structure itself.  Instead we create a
// reflective data structure containing all necessary information for
// the algorithms processing Grob_properties.
