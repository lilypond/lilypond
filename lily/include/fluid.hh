// Fluid is a wrapper class for cached storage of GUILE fluids.
// You use it like
//
//   Fluid parser (Lily::f_parser);
//
// and when you first access `parser' as an SCM value, its value is
// fetched from the respective fluid (in this case `%parser', cf
// lily/lily-imports.cc) and cached for future accesses.
//
// Since fluids act as implicit function parameters, it can only be
// meaningfully employed for variables of automatic
// (function/block-local) duration.
//
// Once you create a fluid cache, it should be passed around by
// reference in order to keep the performance impact low.

class Fluid
{
  SCM const fluid_; // the fluid itself
  SCM value_;       // its cached value, SCM_UNDEFINED if unset

  Fluid ();              // No accessible default constructor
  Fluid (const Fluid &); // Don't copy
  // Caching fluids only makes sense if we really treat them as
  // function parameters, namely only modify them synchronized to
  // function calls, like when using scm_with_fluid.  So no assignment
  // operator or any other interface to scm_fluid_set_x.
  Fluid &operator= (const Fluid &);
