  Extenders must be entered manually for now.

  Although it would be possible for Lily to determine where to
  put extender lines, it's quite a tricky thing to do.  Also,
  this would demand quite strict lyrics entries.

  Note: the extender is only used for one-syllable words, or
  for on a word's last syllable.  The extender should be aligned
  with the left side of the last note of the melissima, and not
  extend beond, lasting the whole duration of the melissima
