/*
 * This abstract class serves as common superclass for all ligature
 * engravers thet produce a single connected graphical object of fixed
 * width, consisting of noteheads and other primitives (see class
 * Ligature_engraver for more information on the interaction between
 * this class and its superclass).  In particular, it cares for the
 * following tasks:
 *
 * - provide a function for putting all grobs of the ligature into a
 * single paper column,
 *
 * - delegate actual creation of ligature to concrete subclass,
 *
 * - except in Kievan notation, collect all accidentals that occur
 * within the ligature and put them at the left side of the ligature
 * (TODO; see function collect_accidentals ()),
 *
 * - collapse superflous space after each ligature (TODO).
 *
 * Concrete subclasses must implement function build_ligature (Spanner
 * *, vector<Grob_info>).  This function is responsible for actually
 * building the ligature by transforming the array of noteheads.
 *
 * Currently, there are two subclasses: Gregorian_ligature_engraver
 * for Gregorian chant notation (also known as plain song or cantus
 * planus) and Mensural_ligature_engraver for white mensural notation.
 * Subclasses for other music notation styles such as modal notation
 * or ars nova notation may eventually be added.
 */

/*
 * TODO: local accidentals: collect accidentals that occur within a
 * ligature and put them before the ligature.  If an accidental
 * changes within a ligature, print a warning (user error) and ignore
 * any further accidental for that pitch within that ligature
 * (actually, in such a case, the user should split the ligature into
 * two separate ligatures).  Similarly, any object that, in ordinary
 * notation, may be put to the left or to the right of a note-head,
 * should be collected and put before or after the ligature.
 *
 * TODO: make spacing more robust: do not screw up spacing if user
 * erroneously puts rest in ligature.
 *
 * TODO: for each ligature, add Rod that represents the total length
 * of the ligature (to preemptively avoid collision with adjacent
 * notes); or maybe just additionally create a
 * mensural/vaticana/whatever-ligature grob (e.g. via
 * Mensural_ligature::print (SCM)) that just consists of a
 * bounding box around all primitives of the ligature.
 *
 * TODO: Maybe move functions fold_up_primitives () and
 * join_primitives () from subclasses to here?  N.B. it is not
 * appropriate to put these into Ligature_engraver, since, for
 * example, Ligature_bracket_engraver does not share any of this code.
