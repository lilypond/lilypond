  Context properties for setting MIDI controls.  Each MIDI control
  specification has the following components:
    1. The name of the LilyPond context property used to change the value of
       the MIDI control.
    2. The lower bound for the numeric range of the LilyPond context property.
    3. The upper bound for the numeric range of the LilyPond context property.
    4. The MIDI control number for setting the most significant 7 bits of the
       control value.
    5. The MIDI control number for setting the least significant 7 bits of the
       control value, if the control supports 14-bit ("fine") resolution.  If
       the control supports only 7-bit ("coarse") resolution, the LSB control
       number should be negative.
