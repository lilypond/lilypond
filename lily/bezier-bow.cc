  For small w, the height should be proportional to w, for w ->
  infinity, the height should rise to a limit asymptotically.

  Hence we take F (x) such that
  F (0) = 0 , F' (0) = 1, and F (infty) = 1

  and use

  h = h_infinity * F (x * r_0 / h_infinity)


  Examples:

  * F (x) = 2/pi * atan (pi x/2)

  * F (x) = 1/alpha * x^alpha / (1 + x^alpha)

  * (etc.)

  [with the 2nd recipe you can determine how quickly the conversion from
  `small' slurs to `big' slurs occurs.]

  Although this might seem cand_idates to SCM-ify, it is not all clear
  which parameters (ie. h_inf, r_0, F (.)) should be candidates for
  this.  At present h_inf and r_0 come from layout settings, but we did
  no experiments for determining the best combinations of F, h_inf and
  r_0.


  The indent is proportional to the height of the slur for small
  slurs.  For large slurs, this gives a certain hookiness at the end,
  so we increase the indent.

  indent = G (w)

  w -> 0,  G (w) -> .33 w


  (due to derivative constraints, we cannot have indent > len/3)

  w -> inf, G (w) -> 2*h_inf

  i.e.


  G (0) = 0 , G'(0) 1/3, G (infty) = 2h_inf

  solve from

  G (w) = r  + p/(w+q)

  yields

  G (w) = 2 h_inf - max_fraction * q^2/ (w + q)

  with q = 2 h_inf
