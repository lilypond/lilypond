lilypond (1.4.12-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream maintenance release.
  * Several important fixes (including our bison-related patch added
    to 1.4.10-1) are included since 1.4.11 this release.  (Now, I
    don't even need to increase teTeX's extra_mem_top, extra_mem_bot
    or pool_size!  :-)  Please include in Woody.
  * Fixed a typo in lilypond-doc package description: typestting ->
    typesetting.  Thanks, Matt Zimmerman!  (Closes: Bug#125083)

lilypond (1.4.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * lilypond failed to build with bison >= 1.30 because bison's output file
    has been renamed.  Applied an upstream fix.  (Closes: Bug#133692)
  * lilypond's documentation also failed to build with the latest
    tetex or texinfo package.  Instead of increasing extra_mem_top and
    extra_mem_bot, increasing pool_size does the trick.

lilypond (1.4.9-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Oops, libc6-dev is known as libc6.1-dev and libc-dev on some
    architectures.  Fixed Build-Depends so that lilypond can be built
    on all platforms.  Thanks to Colin Watson for reporting the bug.
    (Closes: Bug#120208)

lilypond (1.4.8-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * [debian/rules]: Use -s instead of -a so that lilypond would get built
     on all architectures even when the dummy lilypond1.3 package isn't
     built.  Thanks to Ryan Murray for the report.  (Closes: Bug#117622)
  * Depends on python instead of python-base.  The python scripts in
    lilypond work with old and new Python versions.
  * Build-Depends on "-z combreloc"-enabled binutils (>= 2.11.92.0.10-2)
    and libc6-dev (>= 2.2.4-5) so that lily runs faster!  :-)

lilypond (1.4.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: Bug#111132)
  * Stopped using $(PWD) in make, as it doesn't seems to work on
    potato systems with older "make".  Reverted to `pwd`.
    Thanks to Wolfgang Schnitker for notifying me this problem.
  * Changed the lilypond1.3 dummy package's Architecture from "all"
    to "arm i386 m68k powerpc sparc".  Also, as upstream updated
    config.sub and config.guess to recognize ia64 and hppa.
    Thanks to Anthony Towns for the bug report.  (Closes: Bug#114266)
  * Versioned Build-Depends: flex (>= 2.5.4a-14) to ensure gcc-3.0
    compatibility.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Oct 2001 18:28:45 +0800

lilypond (1.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream includes lexer-gcc-3.0.patch which should fix compilation
    problems with g++-3.0.  (Closes: Bug#105001)
  * Hurray!  texinfo-4.0b is finally in Debian!  Thanks, Josip!  :-)
    Updated Build-Depends.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Jul 2001 03:04:37 +0800

lilypond (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Urgency high because Lilypond-1.2.17 is too buggy and yet it has
    been stuck in testing forever.  Lilypond-1.4.x fixes multiple
    serious bugs.  :-)
  * Ah, silly me, lilypond was conflicting against itself!  I forgot
    to remove this relics during the switch from lilypond1.3 to lilypond.
  * Fixed a new bug in lily/main.cc which caused lilypond to skip over every
    other command-line argument.
  * [configure.in]: Added -mieee to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS when building on
     Alpha to prevent FP exception.  Thanks to Christopher C. Chimelis
     for the fix!

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jun 2001 00:42:46 -0600

lilypond (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved "bibtex2html, gs | gs-aladdin, netpbm (>= 2:9.10-1)"
    from Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep because these packages
    are only needed for building lilypond-doc.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Tue, 29 May 2001 02:26:58 -0600

lilypond (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: Bug#97598)
  * export extra_mem_top=100000 and extra_mem_bot=100000, otherwise
    latex runs out of memory when processing standchen.dvi.latex.
  * Split the documentation into the "lilypond-doc" package, which
    provides the LilyPond website in /usr/share/doc/lilypond/html.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 16 May 2001 16:03:40 -0600

lilypond (1.3.150-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Renamed package from lilypond1.3 back to lilypond.
    This also fixes a lot of bugs from the old lilypond-1.2.17 package.
    lilypond1.3 is temporarily provided as a dummy transitional package.
    Closes: Bug#67697, 84352, 48731, 72223, 85834.
  * [debian/rules]:
     - No longer blindly copy intermediate DVI files into
       the deb package.  Thanks to Daniel Burrows for the reminder.
       Closes: Bug#87852.
     - Added "export MODE=ljfour" and "export BDPI=600" because I use
       something different in my local /etc/texmf/mktex.cnf and that
       broke the build.
  * Fixed Build-Depends because pnmtopng has been merged into the netpbm
    package.  Thanks to Adrian Bunk for the notice.  Closes: Bug#93961.
  * [lily/kpath.cc]: Modified to better conform to web2c fontpath policy.

lilypond1.3 (1.3.132-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
  * Oops, in 1.3.129-1, the "(setq auto-mode-alist (append ..." line in
    /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50lilypond1.3.el (debian/emacsen-startup)
    and in FAQ.txt was buggy.  Thanks to Erik Demaine for the bug report.
    Closes: Bug#86685.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Feb 2001 20:27:09 -0700

lilypond1.3 (1.3.129-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * In memory of Werner Icking + (August 26, 1943 - February 8, 2001),
    a dear friend, a kind educator, and a hard worker in sharing beautiful
    typeset music to the world.  (Maintainer of the GMD Music Archive,
    http://www.gmd.de/Misc/Music/).

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream has changed from "lilypond-mode" to the "studly caps name"
    "LilyPond-mode".  Fixed /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50lilypond1.3.el
    (debian/emacsen-startup).  Thanks to Christophe Rhodes for the bug
    report.  Closes: Bug#83732.
  * Added "Build-Conflicts: lilypond, lilypond1.3" to prevent old
    lilypond font files from potentially interfering with the build on
    other Debian ports autobuilders.
  * Built with libguile-dev (1:1.4-9) or newer to ensure correct
    linkage to libqthreads.so.9.  Also updated the Build-Depends and
    Depends fields accordingly.  Thanks to guile1.4 package maintainer
    Rob Browning for his notification and to Daniel Burrows for his bug
    report.  Closes: Bug#85896.

lilypond1.3 (1.3.121-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added more detailed instruction for building lilypond1.3 on Debian
    in Documentation/topdocs/INSTALL.texi (hence INSTALL.txt).
  * Applied Han-wen's one-line patch to lily/system-start-delimiter.cc
    to remove bracket-width.
  * It seems that bracket-width needs to be removed from
    scm/grob-description.scm and scm/interface-description.scm too.

    without error.

lilypond (1.1.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Known problem: LilyPond simply segfaults under glibc 2.1 on my i386
    system, and I don't know how to fix the problem yet.  I hope users of
    other platforms have better luck.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - Make and install info files.
      - Removed "CC=egcc" because the default gcc on all platforms is
        now the one from egcs.

  * [scripts/ly2dvi.py]: Re-added a patch similar to the one in 1.0.17-1,

lilypond (1.0.18-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * [debian/control]:
      - Upgraded to standards version 2.5.0.0 (no changes).
      - Recommends: python-misc (>= 1.5.1) because ly2dvi needs the glob
        module in the python-misc package (closes: Bug#29283).
      - Updated dependencies on tetex* to the latest versions:
          Depends: tetex-bin (>= 0.9.981031-2)
          Recommends: tetex-base (>= 0.9.981030-1)
        due to changes in tetex's directory structure.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - The symlink ../../../../../share/lilypond/mf is now named
        /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/source/public/lilypond instead of
        /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/source/public/mf (Bug#29284).
      - In the latest tetex-base package, /usr/lib/texmf/doc is now a
        symlink to /usr/doc/texmf.  Therefore, we now install lilypond's
        documentation into /usr/doc/texmf/musixtex/lilypond.
        (closes: Bug#28999, Bug#29326)
  * [debian/preinst]:
      - The script now removes the directories
        /var/spool/texmf/pk/*/public/mf and /var/spool/texmf/tfm/public/mf
        created inadvertently by Debian's buggy lilypond 1.0.17-1.  :-)
        (Bug#29284)
      - Since 1.0.17-1, /usr/lib/texmf/tex/lilypond has been changed to a
        symbolic directory.  The script now removes the old real directory
        to prevent problems during upgrade (closes: Bug#29284).
  * [debian/postinst]: I copied a few lines from tetex-nonfree's postinst
      to remove the old directory /usr/lib/texmf/doc if lilypond is the
      last package to use that directory, and create a symlink to
      /usr/doc/texmf.  :-)
  * Rebuilt with yodl (1.31.7-1) installed to ensure the documentations
    are compiled properly (closes: Bug#29285).
  * Thanks to Fabien Ninoles <fab@tzone.org>, Roland Rosenfeld
    <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> and Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk>
    for reporting the bugs listed above. :-)

      - Updated debian/rules according to the new debhelper rules example.
      - Now configures with --disable-optimise instead of --enable-optimise,
        otherwise it would not compile.
      - Added symlinks to directories under /usr/lib/texmf because lilypond
        now puts everything under /usr/share/lilypond.
  * [Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.yo]: Added a trailing "/" on URLs. 
  * [scripts/ly2dvi.py]: Added a hack to add an extra os.pathsep (":" on
      Linux) to TEXINPUTS and MFINPUTS, otherwise ly2dvi and TeX would fail
      to find the necessary files.
  * Compiled with libstdc++2.9.  :-)

lilypond (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * [aclocal.m4]: Temporarily changed OPTIMIZE="-O2" to OPTIMIZE="-O"
      to avoid egcs (c++) complaint of "Internal compiler error"
      on my computer.
  * [scripts/mudela-book.py]: Added "#!@PYTHON@" at the top.  This string
      expands to "#!/usr/bin/python" in /usr/bin/mudela-book.
      (Thanks to Lintian.  :-)
  * [debian/control]: Recommends: python-base (>= 1.5.1).
      (Again, thanks to Lintian.  :-)
  * [debian/postrm]: Now also removes the generated LilyPond fonts
      *.{tfm,pk} under /var/spool/texmf when called as "postrm remove".
  * [debian/preinst]: Yes, have to bring this back to remove the generated
      LilyPond fonts in /var/spool/texmf because "postrm remove" didn't do
      its jobs in previous versions.  Oops.  :-)
  * [debian/rules]: Installs a few new upstream documentation files, and
      the example files in out/ directories are moved to parent directories.

lilypond (0.1.60-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release with lots of bug fixes, including the MIDI
    generation bug in 0.1.48.  Please put this in Hamm.
  * debian/control:
     - Upgraded to standards version 2.4.1.0 (no changes).
  * debian/rules:
     - lilypond now also depends on tetex-base (>= 0.9-5)
       and conflicts with tetex-base (<< 0.9).
  * Modified postinst and postrm to work with teTeX 0.9 / Web2C 7.2:
     - Removed all the *ugly* kludges and functions that were supposed to
       deal with non-Debian teTeX installations.  Those kludges were
       specifically made for teTeX 0.4, but they failed to work as intended
       due to the changes in teTeX 0.9.
     - No longer messes with special.map because the standard
       Web2C 7.2 special.map already lists the feta fonts.
     - Since postinst is so much simpler, it is now a sh script!  :-)
  * Removed preinst which contained yet another obsolete kludge to clean
    obsolete/ancient lilypond fonts.
  * Updated the GNU LilyPond Home Page URIs.

lilypond (0.1.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream "The Utrecht Release".
  * Compiled on va.debian.org because egcs 1.0.1 on my computer
    no longer comes with libg++.  :-(  But hey, va.debian.org
    sure is fast!  <grin>
  * Temporarily includes *.xpm instead of *.gif files because
    the netpbm package is not installed on va.debian.org, and
    also because it violates Policy 2.1.2.  Thanks to
    James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk> for bug report!  :-)
    (Fixes Bug#18212)

  * debian/control:
     - No longer Recommends: "musixtex" or "musixtex-fonts" because
       LilyPond no longer needs them.
     - Therefore, Section: is changed from "contrib/tex" to "tex".
       LilyPond can finally go into the main distribution.  Hurray!
  * debian/rules: Now also dh_installdocs ANNOUNCE-0.1 and ONEWS.

lilypond (0.1.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Applied a small fix to postinst.  The font-entries-search-and-replace
    add_fonts() subroutine was slightly buggy.
  * Unpatched ./configure.  It turned out that I spelt "--enable-optimise"
    as "--enable-optimize" in debian/rules by mistake.  Oops!  :)  Thanks
    to the upstream author for pointing this out!  :)
  * The upstream authors has included the ./debian/* files in the pristine
    source archive!  They also fixed some minor errors in README.debian
    and copyright.  Thanks a lot!  :)
  * Removed the line "dh_clean" from "binary-arch:" and switched the order
    of dh_clean in "clean:" in debian/rules.  dh_clean was deleting
    the zero-byte file ./make/out/Site.make, causing the build to fail.

lilypond (0.1.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

    on all the files.  Now, /usr/bin/lilypond is a lot leaner!  <smile>
    (I will discuss it with the upstream author.)
  * Adapted postinst (a Perl script) from the musixtex package for lilypond.
    Now postinst adds the new LilyPond font entries into
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Added preinst to clean up my mess from previous releases: the old
    "stray" automatically generated TFM and PK font files were placed in
    the wrong directories because they were not listed in
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Did some minor clean-up in debian/rules and switched to debhelper.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 2.3.0.1
