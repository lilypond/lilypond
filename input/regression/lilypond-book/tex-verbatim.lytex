\section{verb and verbatim}

This file should not contain (and produce) any lilypond images!

Snippets inside a verbatim environment or a comment are not run through
lilypond, but left as is.

You should see the begin/end lilypond commands in all three of the below tests.

% TODO: These do not yet work, as \verb is explicitly disabled in lilypond-book for now!
% \verb|\lilypond[fragment]{c' d' e'}|
%
% and

The verbatim environment does not confuse lilypond-book:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{lilypond}
c d e
\end{lilypond}
\end{verbatim}


% TODO: These do not yet work, as \verb is explicitly disabled in lilypond-book for now!
% \verb|\begin{lilypond}[fragment]c d e\end{lilypond}|

% \verb+\lilypondfile[quote,noindent]{screech-and-boink.ly}+

Neither does a verbatim inside verb:

\verb|\begin{verbatim}\begin{lilypond}[fragment]c d e\end{lilypond}\end{verbatim}|

or verb inside verbatim:

\begin{verbatim}
\verb|\begin{lilypond}[fragment]c d e\end{lilypond}|
\end{verbatim}

But these are just to stress \verb|lilypond-book|.
