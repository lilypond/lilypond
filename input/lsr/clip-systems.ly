This code shows how to clip (extract) snippets from a full score.

This file needs to be run separately with @code{-dclip-systems}; the
snippets page may not adequately show the results.

The result will be files named
@file{@var{base}-from-@var{start}-to-@var{end}[-@var{count}].eps}.

@itemize
@item
If system starts and ends are included, they include extents of the
System grob, e.g., instrument names.

@item
Grace notes at the end point of the region are not included.

@item
Regions can span multiple systems.  In this case, multiple EPS files
are generated.
