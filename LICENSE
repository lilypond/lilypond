The following exceptions apply:

    The font exception for the GPL stipulates the following exception:

      If you create a document which uses fonts included in LilyPond,
      and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the
      document, then this font does not by itself cause the resulting
      document to be covered by the GNU General Public License.  This
      exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
      document might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
      If you modify one or more of the fonts, you may extend this
      exception to your version of the fonts but you are not obliged
      to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
      statement from your version.

  * It does not apply to python/auxiliar/vendored/pygments.zip, which
    is a vendored dependency, itself licensed under the BSD 2-clause
    "simplified" license.
