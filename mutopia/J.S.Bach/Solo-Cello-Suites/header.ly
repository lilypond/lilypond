%{
Header for Solo Cello Suite no. 2.

This is the 2nd cello suite by Bach, in versions for both cello and
viola.  It was coded by JCN following a Baerenreiter
urtext. Optionally you can add or remove slurs etc. to taste. 

The setup of the files is slightly complicated, because sharing of
information is taken to the extreme.
