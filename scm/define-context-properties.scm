staves share accidentals, and if @var{context} is @rinternals{Staff} then

The procedure represents an accidental rule to be applied to the previously

@table @code

@item context
The current context to which the rule should be applied.

@item pitch
The pitch of the note to be evaluated.

@item barnum
