@macro manualIntro
This document shows a selected set of LilyPond snippets from the
@uref{https://lsr@/.di@/.unimi@/.it,LilyPond Snippet Repository}
(LSR).  It is in the public domain.

We would like to address many thanks to Sebastiano Vigna for maintaining
LSR web site and database, and the University of Milano for hosting LSR.

Please note that this document is not an exact subset of LSR: some
snippets come from @file{input/new} LilyPond sources directory, and
snippets from LSR are converted through @command{convert-ly}, as LSR is
based on a stable LilyPond version, and this document is for
version @version{}.

Snippets are grouped by tags; tags listed in the table of contents match
a section of LilyPond notation manual.  Snippets may have several tags,
and not all LSR tags may appear in this document.

In the HTML version of this document, you can click on the file name
or figure for each example to see the corresponding input file.
