<title>LilyPond version 2.4 released</title>
<pre>


Dear music enthusiasts,


LilyPond version 2.4 was released today!


LilyPond is a program for making beautiful music notation.  It is
open source/free software, and is available for all popular operating
systems. It runs on most Unix flavors --including Linux and MacOS X--
and MS Windows. Use it for your music too!

With this release, LilyPond does not rely anymore on TeX to do titling
and page layout, but distributes page breaks optimally to produce
evenly spaced pages, while respecting user specified turning points.

The slur formatting code has been completely rewritten, and now yields
classical engraving quality results for most cases.

In addition, version 2.4 adds fret diagrams, a safe execution mode for
webserver use, a further simplified input format, better typography
for ledger lines, many bugfixes and a fully revised and updated
manual.
