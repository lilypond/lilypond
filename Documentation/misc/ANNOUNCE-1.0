GNU LilyPond - The Music Typesetter


WHAT IS LilyPond?

LilyPond is the GNU Project music typesetter.  This program can print
beautiful sheet music from a music definition file.  It can also play
performances to a MIDI file.


WHAT'S NEW SINCE VERSION 0.1?

* LilyPond now includes a completely new music font: the Feta font.
  We were quite disappointed with available music fonts, so we rolled
  our own.  We did our best to copy the best symbol designs available,
  and we think that we've succeeded in doing so.  We're proud of the
  result, and we hope you agree, so go check it out!

* More elegant output due to

	* more sophisticated beam/slur formatting
	* better spacing
	* better line breaking
	* better font design
	* PostScript output for variable symbols

* Lots of bugfixes

* More robust, flexible and tweakable design

* Better MIDI file importing

* Easier to use due to better shell scripts and input format
enhancements

* MusixTeX is not needed anymore

* Faster



FEATURES

* Multiple staffs, polyphonic music (more voices on one staff),
Polymetric music.

* Support for full orchestral score: Hara_kiri systems (lines with
only rests are automatically skipped), multi-measure rests, bar
