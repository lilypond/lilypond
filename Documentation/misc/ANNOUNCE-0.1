GNU LilyPond - The GNU Project Music Typesetter



``WHAT IS GNU LilyPond?''

Well Mike, GNU LilyPond is a program which converts music definition
files into visual or auditive output: it can typeset formatted sheet
music to a TeX file and (mechanical) performances to MIDI files.


We have been working very hard on this system for the past year, and
we finally think that it is ready to be used and hacked at by a larger
public than us.


WHY ?

We want to create tools to produce production quality scores and parts
of public domain music.


BUT ..

We haven't yet reached that goal:

* The quality of the output isn't good enough yet due to some
unsophisticated algorithms

* Some features haven't been implemented, due to lack of time; most of
them can be done quite simply

This is why we don't consider this software stable yet. It generally
does what it is supposed to, but we reserve the right to make
(incompatible) changes to the input format.  We consider it
of BETA quality.


WE WANT YOU!

You can become a user, but we'd really appreciate it if you would start
hacking at Lily, and help us advance our project more quickly.


``YES, IT IS FANTASTIC! WHAT DO I NEED?''

For compilation you need

	Unix. (windows32 is known to work, too)
	GNU C++ v2.7 or better, with libg++ installed.
	GNU make.
	Flex (2.5.1 or better).
	Bison. (1.25 or better)

For running you need

	TeX
	MusiXTeX fonts

The MusiXTeX fonts are part of the MusiXTeX package version T.73,
available at any CTAN mirror, or http://www.gmd.de/Misc/Music/


``WHAT CAN LILYPOND DO?''

ASCII script input (mudela), with identifiers (for music reuse),
customizable notenames.

MIDI output lets you check if you have entered the correct notes.
MIDI to Mudela conversion through the mi2mu program.

Multiple staffs in one score. Each staff can have a different meters.
Multiple voices within one staff (up to four handled graciously);
beams optionally shared between voices.  Multiple scores within one
input file. Each score is output to a different file.

Beams, slurs, chords, super/subscripts (accents and text),
general n-plet (triplet, quadruplets, etc.), lyrics, transposition,
dynamics (both absolute and hairpin style), clef changes, meter
changes, cadenza-mode, key changes, repeat bars.

Integration with LaTeX through Perl scripts.

THANK YOU,

Thanks go out to Mats Bengtsson, Werner Lemberg and Richard Stallman
for comments and contributions.


****	NOTE

LilyPond might have a minor bug if  you use glibc-2; we will look into it
If you use glibc-2, please try 0.1.0 to see if it works and, download 0.1.1
when it's available.

LilyPond might exhibit a g++ bug on Solaris 1.5 (The stack frame gets corrupted
by a constructor) if you compile with -O2. We don't know workarounds.

    We would like to dedicate this program to all the friends that we
			 met through music.


	Those deserving special mention (in no particular order):
Esther, Marijke, Heike, Inge, Judith, Hannah, Auke, Ilse, Evelyn,
Maartje, Suzanne, Ilse (gee, again?) and last (but certainly not least)
Janneke!

	HWN

	That's a nice thought, Wendy.  I've got a few too, to spread
the credits a bit (Again, no particular order) Michelle, Illushka,
Ruth, Eva, Fro/ydis, Monique, Noor, Sascha, Monique, Ilse, Monique,
Eva, Roos, Judith, Tim and, of course, Wendy!

Of course, our other friends in the `Eindhovens Jongeren Ensemble'
(http://www.stack.nl/~hanwen/eje.html) cannot go unmentioned either.
