Subject: LilyPond 2.0  - make beautiful music prints


Dear music enthousiasts,


LilyPond version 2.0 was released today. LilyPond is an automated
music notation system: it is used to make gorgeous sheet music.  It is
libre software ("open source"), and available for most Unix flavors,
including Linux and MacOS X, and MS Windows.

Use it for your music too!

For this version, we have dramatically simplified many parts of the
syntax, making it easier to use than ever before.  Other improvements
include quarter-tone accidentals, and conditional inclusion of music
fragments. With version 2.0, we have a solid platform for working on
notation and typography features for coming versions.

Downloads, examples and documentation are available from the website,

	http://lilypond.org

<h2>New features in 2.0 since 1.8</h2>

     <ul>

     <li>Crescendos can now be drawn dotted or dashed.

     <li>Quarter tones are now supported. They are entered by suffixing
<code>ih</code> for a half-sharp and <code>eh</code> for a half-flat. Hence, the
following is an ascending list of pitches:

     <pre class="example">            ceses ceseh ces ceh c cih cis cisih cisis
          </pre>

     <li>The following constructs have been removed from the syntax:

     <pre class="example">            \duration #SCHEME-DURATION
            \pitch #SCHEME-PITCH
            \outputproperty <var>func</var> <var>symbol</var> = <var>value</var>
          </pre>

     <p>For <code>\outputproperty</code>, the following may be substituted:

     <pre class="example">             \applyoutput #(outputproperty-compatibility <var>func</var>
                            <var>symbol</var> <var>value</var>)
          </pre>

     </p><li>Clefs may now be transposed arbitrarily, for example

     <pre class="example">            \clef "G_8"
            \clef "G_15"
            \clef "G_9"
          </pre>

     <li>The syntax for chords and simultaneous music have changed.
Chords are entered as

     <pre class="example">             &lt;<var>pitches</var>&gt;
          </pre>

     <p>while simultaneous music is entered as

     <pre class="example">             &lt;&lt;<var>..music list..</var>&gt;&gt;
          </pre>

     <p>In effect, the meanings of both have been swapped relative to their 1.8
definition.  The syntax for lists in <code>\markup</code> has changed
alongside, but figured bass mode was not  changed, i.e.:

     <pre class="example">            \markup { \center &lt;<var>..list of markups..</var>&gt; }
            \figure { &lt;<var>figures</var>&gt; }
          </pre>

     <p>As chords the more often used than simultaneous music, this change will
save keystrokes.

     </p><li>Each music expression can now be tagged, to make different printed
versions from the same music expression.  In the following example,
we see two versions of a piece of music, one for the full score, and
one with cue notes for the instrumental part:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;&lt; \tag #'part &lt;&lt;
            { c4 f2 g4 }      % in the part, we have cue-notes
            \\ R1 &gt;&gt;
            \tag #'score R1  % in the score: only a rest
          &gt;&gt;
          </pre>

     <p>The same can be applied to articulations, texts, etc.: they are
made by prepending

     <pre class="example">                  -\tag #<var>your-tags</var>
          </pre>

     <p>to an articulation, for example,

     <pre class="example">                  c4-\tag #'with-fingerings -4 -\tag #'with-strings \6
          </pre>

     <p>This defines a note, which has a conditional fingering and a
string-number indication.

     </p><li>The settings for chord-fingering are more flexible. You can specify a
list where fingerings may be placed, eg.

     <pre class="example">            \property Voice.fingeringOrientations = #'(left down)
          </pre>

     <p>This will put the fingering for the lowest note below the chord, and the
rest to the left.

     </p><li>The script previously known as <code>ly2dvi</code> has been renamed to
<code>lilypond</code>. The binary itself is now installed as
<code>lilypond-bin</code>.

     <li>Markup text (ie. general text formatting) may now be used for lyrics too.

     <li>Two new commands for grace notes have been added, <code>\acciaccatura</code>
and <code>\appoggiatura</code>,

     <pre class="example">            \appoggiatura f8 e4
            \acciaccatura g8 f4
          </pre>

     <p>Both reflect the traditional meanings of acciaccatura and appoggiatura,
and both insert insert a slur from the first grace note to the main
note.

     </p><li>Layout options for grace notes are now stored in a context property,
and may now be set separately from musical content.

     <li>The <code>\new</code> command will create a context with a unique
name automatically. Hence, for multi-staff scores, it is no longer
necessary to invent arbitrary context names. For example, a two-staff
score may be created by

     <pre class="example">            \simultaneous {
              \new Staff { <var>notes for 1st staff</var> }
              \new Staff { <var>notes for 2nd staff</var> }
            }
          </pre>

     <li>Octave checks make octave errors easier to correct.
The syntax is

     <pre class="example">            \octave <var>pitch</var>
          </pre>

     <p>This checks that <var>pitch</var> (without octave) yields <var>pitch</var> (with
octave) in \relative mode. If not, a warning is printed, and the
octave is corrected.

     </p><li>All articulations must now be entered postfix. For example,

     <pre class="example">            c8[( d8])
          </pre>

     <p>is a pair of beamed slurred eighth notes.

     </p><li>The definition of <code>\relative</code> has been simplified.  Octaves are
now always propagated in the order that music is entered. In the
following example,

     <pre class="example">            PRE
            \repeat "unfold" 3  BODY \alternative { ALT1 ALT2 }
            POST
          </pre>

     <p>the octave of BODY is based on PRE, the starting octave of ALT1 on
BODY, the starting octave of ALT2 on ALT1, and the starting octave of
POST on ALT2.

     <p>The same mechanism is used for all other music expressions, except the
chord. Backwards compatibility is retained through a special program option,
which is set through

     <pre class="example">            #(ly:set-option 'old-relative)
          </pre>

     </p><li>Windows users can double click a <code>.ly</code> file to process and view
it automagically through the new <code>lily-wins</code> frontend.

</ul>
