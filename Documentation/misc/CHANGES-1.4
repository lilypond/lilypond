1.4.2.jcn4
==========

* Windows: bugfix for tex-wrappers, added tex wrapper for dvips.
LilyPond (read: ly2dvi) should now work right out of the box.

Amazing; it seems that ly2dvi won't generate PK files without this
dvips wrapper.  We had over 200 downloads of setup.exe, yet only one
`call for help'.  Did all the others give up, or did none of them
bother to share their fix/file a bug report?  Urg.

* Included mktexnam.patch (again?).

* Documentation fix (Mark Hindley).

* Debian patch and bashism fix (Anthony).

* Bugfix: local-install should depend on $(INSTALLATION_FILES).  This fixes
./configure; make install in buildscripts/ (Michael Vanier).

* Removed les-nereides from short-examples, as it is tweaked a lot,
contrary to what the webpage claims (didn't know that).

1.4.2.mb1
==========

* ly2dvi, titledefs.tex: Typeset copyright notice at the bottom of the
first page. Make separate page styles for first and last page.

* Bugfix: Default RehearsalMark font-family changed to roman (only
affects Scheme text markups).

1.4.2.hwn1
==========

* Added support for Q: statement to abc2ly. (Laura Conrad)

* Tie shape bugfix (Mark Hindley).

* Bugfix: lilypond-book LatexPaper.__setattr__()

1.4.0.jcn7
==========
