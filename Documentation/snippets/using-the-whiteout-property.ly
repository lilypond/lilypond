Any graphical object can be printed over a white background to mask
parts of objects that lie beneath.  This can be useful to improve the
appearance of collisions in complex situations when repositioning
objects is impractical.  It is necessary to explicitly set the
@code{layer} property to control which objects are masked by the white
background. In this example the collision of the tie with the time
signature is improved by masking out the part of the tie that crosses
the time signature by setting the @code{whiteout} property of
@code{TimeSignature}. To do this @code{TimeSignature} is moved to a
layer above @code{Tie}, which is left in the default layer of 1, and
@code{StaffSymbol} is moved to a layer above @code{TimeSignature} so it
is not masked.
