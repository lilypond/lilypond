Kneed beams are inserted automatically when a large gap is detected
between the note heads.  This behavior can be tuned through the
@code{auto-knee-gap} property.  A kneed beam is drawn if the gap is
larger than the value of @code{auto-knee-gap} plus the width of the
beam object (which depends on the duration of the notes and the slope
of the beam). By default @code{auto-knee-gap} is set to 5.5 staff
spaces.
