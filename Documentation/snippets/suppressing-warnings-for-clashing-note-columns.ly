If notes from two voices with stems in the same direction are placed at
the same position, and both voices have no shift or the same shift
specified, the error message @samp{warning: ignoring too many clashing
note columns} will appear when compiling the LilyPond file.  This
message can be suppressed by setting the @code{'ignore-collision}
property of the @code{NoteColumn} object to @code{#t}. Please note that
this does not just suppress warnings but stops LilyPond trying to
resolve collisions at all and so may have unintended results unless
used with care.
