The @code{measureLength} property, together with
@code{measurePosition}, determines when a bar line is needed.  However,
when using @code{\\scaleDurations}, the scaling of durations makes it
difficult to change time signatures.  In this case,
@code{measureLength} should be set manually, using the
@code{ly:make-moment} callback.  The second argument must be the same
as the second argument of @code{\\scaleDurations}.
