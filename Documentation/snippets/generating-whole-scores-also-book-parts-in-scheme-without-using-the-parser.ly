A LilyPond score internally is just a Scheme expression, generated by
the LilyPond parser.  Using Scheme, one can also automatically generate
a score without an input file.  If you have the music expression in
Scheme, a score can be generated by simply calling

@verbatim
(scorify-music music)
@end verbatim

on your music.  This generates a score object, for which you can then
set a custom layout block with

@verbatim
(let* ((layout (ly:output-def-clone $defaultlayout)))
   ; modify the layout here, then assign it:
   (ly:score-add-output-def! score layout)
  )
@end verbatim

Finally, all you have to do it to pass this score to LilyPond for
typesetting.  This snippet defines functions @code{(add-score score)},
@code{(add-text text)}, and @code{(add-music music)} to pass a complete
score, some markup, or some music to LilyPond for typesetting.

This snippet also works for typesetting scores inside a
@code{\\book @{...@}} block as well as top-level scores.  To achieve
this, each score scheduled for typesetting is appended to the list of
top-level scores, and the top-level book handler (which is a Scheme
function called to process a book once a @code{\\book@{...@}} block is
closed) is modified to insert all collected scores so far to the book.
