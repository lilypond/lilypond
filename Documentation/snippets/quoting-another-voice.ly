The @code{quotedEventTypes} property determines the music event types
which should be quoted.  The default value is
@code{(note-event rest-event tie-event beam-event tuplet-span-event)},
which means that only the notes, rests, ties, beams and tuplets of the
quoted voice will appear in the @code{\\quoteDuring} expression.

In the following example, a 16th rest is not quoted since
@code{rest-event} is not in @code{quotedEventTypes}.

For a list of event types, consult the @qq{Music classes} section of the
Internals Reference.
