In some notational conventions beams are allowed to extend over rests.
Depending on preference, these beams may drop @q{stemlets} to help the
eye appreciate the rhythm better, and in some modern music the rest
itself is omitted and only the stemlet remains.

This snippet shows a progression from traditional notation, to beams
over the rest, to stemlets over the rest, to stemlets alone. Stemlets
are generated by overriding the @code{stemlet-length} property of
@code{Stem}, and rests are hidden by using @code{\\hide}.

Some @code{\\markup} elements are included in the source to highlight
the different notations.
