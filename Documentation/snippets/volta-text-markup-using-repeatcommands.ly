Though volte are best specified using @code{\\repeat volta}, the
context property @code{repeatCommands} must be used in cases where the
volta text needs more advanced formatting with @code{\\markup}.

Since @code{repeatCommands} takes a list, the simplest method of
including markup is to use an identifier for the text and embed it in
the command list using the Scheme syntax @code{#`((volta
,@var{textIdentifier}) ...)} (note the use of the backtick after
@code{#} and the comma before @var{textIdentifier}).  Start- and
end-repeat commands can be added as separate list elements:
