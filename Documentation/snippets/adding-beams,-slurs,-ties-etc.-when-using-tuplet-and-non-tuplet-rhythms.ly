LilyPond syntax can involve many unusual placements for parentheses,
brackets etc., which might sometimes have to be interleaved.

For example, when entering a manual beam, the left square bracket has
to be placed @emph{after} the starting note and its duration, not
before. Similarly, the right square bracket should directly follow the
note which is to be at the end of the requested beaming, even if this
note happens to be inside a tuplet section.

This snippet demonstrates how to combine manual beaming, manual slurs,
ties and phrasing slurs with tuplet sections (enclosed within curly
braces).
