The first empty staff can also be removed from the score by setting the
@code{VerticalAxisGroup} property @code{remove-first}. This can be done
globally inside the @code{\\layout} block, or locally inside the
specific staff that should be removed.  In the latter case, you have to
specify the context (@code{Staff} applies only to the current staff) in
front of the property.

The lower staff of the second staff group is not removed, because the
setting applies only to the specific staff inside of which it is
written.
