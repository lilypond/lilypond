In @qq{simple} lead-sheets, sometimes no actual notes are written,
instead only @qq{rhythmic patterns} and chords above the measures are
notated giving the structure of a song. Such a feature is for example
useful while creating/transcribing the structure of a song and also
when sharing lead sheets with guitarists or jazz musicians.
