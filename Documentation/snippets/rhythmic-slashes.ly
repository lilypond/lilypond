In @qq{simple} lead-sheets, sometimes no actual notes are written.
Instead, only @qq{rhythmic patterns} and chords above the measures are
notated to represent the structure of a song. Such a feature can be
useful while creating or transcribing the structure of a song, or when
sharing lead sheets with guitarists or jazz musicians.
