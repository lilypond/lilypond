Often it is easier to manage line and page-breaking information by
keeping it separate from the music by introducing an extra voice
containing only skips along with the @code{\\break}, @code{pageBreak}
and other layout information.

This pattern becomes especially helpful when overriding
@code{line-break-system-details} and the other useful but long
properties of @code{NonMusicalPaperColumnGrob}.
