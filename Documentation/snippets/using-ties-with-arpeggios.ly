Ties are sometimes used to write out arpeggios.  In this case, two tied
notes need not be consecutive.  This can be achieved by setting the
@code{tieWaitForNote} property to @code{#t}.  The same feature is also
useful, for example, to tie a tremolo to a chord, but in principle, it
can also be used for ordinary consecutive notes.
