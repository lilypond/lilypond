Markups attached to a multi-measure rest will be centered above or
below it.  Long markups attached to multi-measure rests do not cause
the measure to expand.  To expand a multi-measure rest to fit the
markup, use an empty chord with an attached markup before the
multi-measure rest. Text attached to a spacer rest in this way is
left-aligned to the position where the note would be placed in the
measure, but if the measure length is determined by the length of the
text, the text will appear to be centered.
