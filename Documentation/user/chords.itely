@cindex chord names
@cindex chord mode

Chords can be entered as simultaneous music, as discussed in
@ref{Chorded notes}.

Chords can also be entered in @qq{chord mode}, which is an input
mode that focuses on the structures of chords in traditional
European music, rather than on specific pitches.  This is
convenient for those who are familiar with using chord names to
describe chords.  More information on different input modes can be
found at @ref{Input modes}.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,ragged-right,relative=1]
\chordmode { c1 g a g c }
@end lilypond

Chords entered using chord mode are music elements, and can be
transposed just like chords entered using simultaneous music.

Chord mode and note mode can be mixed in sequential music:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,ragged-right,relative=1]
<c e g>2 <g b d>
\chordmode { c2 f }
<c e g>2 <g' b d>
\chordmode { f2 g }

@knownissues

When chord mode and note mode are mixed in sequential music, and
chord mode comes first, the note mode will create a new @code{Staff}
context.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,ragged-right,relative=1]
\chordmode { c2 f }
<c e g>2 <g' b d>
@end lilypond

To avoid this behavior, explicitly create the @code{Staff} context:

@knownissues
Only one quality modifier should be used per chord, typically on the 
highest step present in the chord.  Chords with more than quality
modifier will be parsed without an error or warning, but the results
are unpredictable.  Chords that cannot be achieved with a single
quality modifier should be altered by individual pitches, as described
in @ref{Extended and altered chords}.


@node Extended and altered chords
@unnumberedsubsubsec Extended and altered chords

@cindex extended chords
@cindex altered chords

Chord structures of arbitrary complexity can be created in chord
mode.  The modifier string can be used to extend a chord, add or
remove chord steps, raise or lower chord steps, and add a bass note
or create an inversion.

The first number following the @code{:} is taken to be the extent
of the chord.  The chord is constructed by sequentially adding
thirds to the root until the specified number has been reached.
Note that the seventh step added as part of an extended chord will be the
minor or flatted seventh, not the major seventh.
If the extent is not a third (e.g., 6), thirds are added up to the
highest third below the extent, and then the step of the extent is
added.  The largest possible value for the extent is 13.  Any
larger value is interpreted as 13.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=1]
\chordmode {
  c1:2 c:3 c:4 c:5
  c1:6 c:7 c:8 c:9
  c1:10 c:11 c:12 c:13
  c1:14
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
Note that both @code{c:5} and @code{c} produce a C major triad.

Since an unaltered 11 does not sound good when combined with an
unaltered 13, the 11 is removed from a @code{:13} chord (unless it
is added explicitly).

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=1]
\chordmode {
  c1:13 c:13.11 c:m13
}
@end lilypond

@cindex additions, in chords

Individual steps can be added to a chord.  Additions follow the
extent and are prefixed by a dot (@code{.}).  The basic seventh
step added to a chord is the minor or flatted seventh, rather than
the major seventh.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,relative=1]
\chordmode {
  c1:5.6 c:3.7.8 c:3.6.13
}
@end lilypond

Added steps can be as high as desired.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,relative=1]
\chordmode {
  c4:5.15 c:5.20 c:5.25 c:5.30
}
@end lilypond

@cindex chord steps, altering

Added chord steps can be altered by suffixing a @code{-} or @code{+}
sign to the number.  To alter a step that is automatically included
as part of the basic chord structure, add it as an altered step.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,relative=1]
\chordmode {
  c1:7+ c:5+.3- c:3-.5-.7-
}
@end lilypond

@cindex removals, in chords

@funindex ^

Following any steps to be added, a series of steps to be removed
is introduced in a modifier string with a prefix of @code{^}.
If more than one step is to be removed, the steps to be
removed are separated by @code{.} following the
initial @code{^}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,relative=1]
\chordmode {
  c1^3 c:7^5 c:9^3 c:9^3.5 c:13.11^3.7
}
@end lilypond

@funindex sus

The modifier @code{sus} can be added to the modifier string to
create suspended chords.  This removes the 3rd step from the chord.
Append either @code{2} or @code{4} to add the 2nd or 4th step to the
chord.  @code{sus} is equivalent to @code{^3}; @code{sus4} is
equivalent to @code{.4^3}.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]
\chordmode {
  c1:sus c:sus2 c:sus4 c:5.4^3
}
@end lilypond

@funindex /
@cindex chord inversions
@cindex bass note, for chords

Inversions (putting a pitch other than the root on the bottom of the
chord) and added bass notes can be specified by appending
@code{/}@var{pitch} to the chord.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim, relative=2]
\chordmode {
  c1 c/g c/f
}
@end lilypond

@funindex /+

A bass note that is part of the chord can be added, instead of
moved as part of an inversion, by using @code{/+}@var{pitch}.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]
\chordmode {
  c1 c/g c/+g
}
@end lilypond

Chord modifiers that can be used to produce a variety of
standard chords are shown in

interpreted last.

Only the second inversion can be created by adding a bass
note.  The first inversion requires changing the root of
the chord.

@node Customizing chord names
@unnumberedsubsubsec Customizing chord names

@cindex customizing chord names

There is no unique system for naming chords.  Different musical
traditions use different names for the same set of chords.  There
are also different symbols displayed for a given chord name.   The
names and symbols displayed for chord names are customizable.

@cindex jazz chords
@cindex chords, jazz

The basic chord name layout is a system for Jazz music, proposed
by Klaus Ignatzek (see @ref{Literature list}).  The chord naming
system can be modified as described below.  An alternate jazz
chord system has been developed using these modifications.
The Ignatzek and alternate
Jazz notation are shown on the chart in @ref{Chord
name chart}.

@c TODO --  Change this so we don't have a non-verbatim example.
@c  Make short example in docs, then move longer example to
@c  appendix, where the length of the snippet won't matter.

In addition to the different naming systems, different note names
are used for the root in different languages.  The predefined
variables @code{\germanChords}, @code{\semiGermanChords},
@code{\italianChords} and @code{\frenchChords} set these variables.
The effect is demonstrated here:

@lilypondfile[ragged-right]{chord-names-languages.ly}

If none of the existing settings give the desired output, the chord
name display can be tuned through the following properties.

@table @code

@funindex chordRootNamer

@item chordRootNamer

The chord name is usually printed as a letter for the root with an
optional alteration.  The transformation from pitch to letter is
done by this function.  Special note names (for example, the German
@q{H} for a B-chord) can be produced by storing a new function in
this property.

@funindex majorSevenSymbol

@item majorSevenSymbol

This property contains the markup object used to follow the output
of @code{chordRootNamer} to identify a major 7 chord. Predefined
options are @code{whiteTriangleMarkup} and
@code{blackTriangleMarkup}.

@funindex chordNoteNamer

@item chordNoteNamer

When the chord name contains additional pitches other than the root
(e.g., an added bass note), this function is used to print the
additional pitch.  By default the pitch is printed using
@code{chordRootNamer}. The @code{chordNoteNamer} property can be set
to a specialized function to change this behavior.  For example, the
bass note can be printed in lower case.

@funindex chordNameSeparator

@item chordNameSeparator

Different parts of a chord name are normally separated by a slash.
By setting @code{chordNameSeparator}, you can use any desired markup
for a separator.

@funindex chordNameExceptions

@item chordNameExceptions

This property is a list of pairs.  The first item in each pair
is a set of pitches used to identify the steps present in the chord.
The second item is a markup that will follow the @code{chordRootNamer}
output to create the chord name.

@funindex chordPrefixSpacer
@item chordPrefixSpacer

The @q{m} for minor chords is usually printed immediately to the
right of the root of the chord.  A spacer can be placed between
the root and @q{m} by setting @code{chordPrefixSpacer}.
The spacer is not used when the root is altered.

LilyPond has support for figured bass, also called thorough bass
or basso continuo:

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim,fragment]

  \new FiguredBass {

      < _ >4 < 6 5/>4
    }
  }
>>
@end lilypond

The support for figured bass consists of two parts: there is an
input mode, introduced by @code{\figuremode}, that accepts
entry of bass figures, and there is a context named
@code{FiguredBass} that takes care of displaying
@code{BassFigure} objects.  Figured bass can also be displayed
in @code{Staff} contexts.

@code{\figures@{ ... @}} is a shortcut notation for
@code{\new FiguredBass @{ \figuremode @{ ... @} @}}.


Although the support for figured bass may superficially resemble chord
support, it is much simpler.  @code{\figuremode} mode simply
stores the figures and the @code{FiguredBass} context prints them
as entered.  There is no conversion to pitches.

@ignore
Figures are created as markup texts.  Any of the standard markup
properties can be used to modify the display of figures.  For
example, the vertical spacing of the figures may be set with
@code{baseline-skip}.

Figured bass can be displayed using the @code{FiguredBass} context,
or in most staff contexts.

When displayed in a @code{FiguredBass} context, the vertical location
of the figures is independent of the notes on the staff.

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,fragment,quote]

To ensure that continuation lines work properly, it is
safest to use the same rhythm in the figure line as in
the bass line.

<<
  {
    \clef bass
    \repeat unfold 4 { f16. g32 } f8. es16 d8 es
  }
  \figures {
    \bassFigureExtendersOn
    % The extenders are correct here, with the same rhythm as the bass
    \repeat unfold 4 { <6 4->16. <6 4->32 }
    <5>8. r16 <6>8 <6\! 5->
  }

  {
    \clef bass
    \repeat unfold 4 { f16. g32 } f8. es16 d8 es
  }
  \figures {
    \bassFigureExtendersOn
    % The extenders are incorrect here, even though the timing is the same
    <6 4->4 <6 4->4
    <5>8. r16 <6>8 <6\! 5->

When using extender lines, adjacent figures with the same number in
a different figure location can cause the figure positions to invert.

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,fragment,quote,relative=1]
<<
 { fis4 g g, e' }
  \figures {
    \bassFigureExtendersOn
    <6 5>4 <5\! 4> < 5 _!> <6>
  }
>>
@end lilypond

To avoid this problem, simply turn on extenders after the figure that
begins the extender line and turn them off at the end of the extender line.

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,fragment,quote,relative=1]
<<
 { fis4 g g, e' }
  \figures {
    <6 5>4 <5 4>
    \bassFigureExtendersOn
    < 5 _!>4 <6>
    \bassFigureExtendersOff
  }
