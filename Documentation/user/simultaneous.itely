Polyphony in music refers to having more than one voice occurring
in a piece of music.  Polyphony in LilyPond refers to having more
than one voice on the same staff.

A chord is formed by enclosing a set of pitches between @code{<}
and @code{>}.  A chord may be followed by a duration and/or a set
of articulations, just like simple notes:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]
<c e g>2 <c f a>4-> <e g c>-.
@end lilypond

Relative mode can be used for pitches in chords. The octave of each
pitch is chosen using the preceding pitch as a reference except in
the case of the first pitch in a chord: the reference for the first
pitch is the @emph{first} pitch of the preceding chord.

For more information about chords, see @ref{Chord notation}.

@node Simultaneous expressions
@unnumberedsubsubsec Simultaneous expressions

One or more music expressions enclosed in double angle brackets are
taken to be simultaneous.  If the first expression begins with a
single note or if the whole simultaneous expression appears
explicitly within a single voice, the whole expression is placed on
a single staff; otherwise the elements of the simultaneous
expression are placed on separate staves.

The following examples show simultaneous expressions on one staff:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
\new Voice {  % explicit single voice
  << {a4 b g2} {d4 g c,2} >>
}
@end lilypond

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
% single first note
a << {a4 b g}  {d4 g c,} >>
@end lilypond

This can be useful if the simultaneous sections have identical
rhythms, but attempts to attach notes with different durations
to the same stem will cause errors.

The following example shows how simultaneous expressions can
generate multiple staves implicitly:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
% no single first note
<< {a4 b g2}  {d4 g2 c,4} >>
@end lilypond

Here different rhythms cause no problems.


@node Clusters
@unnumberedsubsubsec Clusters

@cindex cluster
@cindex note cluster

@funindex \makeClusters
@funindex makeClusters

A cluster indicates a continuous range of pitches to be played.
They can be denoted as the envelope of a set of notes.  They are
entered by applying the function @code{\makeClusters} to a sequence
of chords, e.g.,

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
\makeClusters { <g b>2 <c g'> }
@end lilypond

Ordinary notes and clusters can be put together in the same staff,
even simultaneously.  In such a case no attempt is made to
automatically avoid collisions between ordinary notes and clusters.

Snippets:
@rlsr{Simultaneous notes}.

Internals Reference:
@rinternals{ClusterSpanner},
@rinternals{ClusterSpannerBeacon},
@rinternals{Cluster_spanner_engraver}.

@knownissues

Clusters look good only if they span at least two chords; otherwise
they appear too narrow.

Clusters do not have a stem and cannot indicate durations by
themselves, but the length of the printed cluster is determined by
the durations of the defining chords.  Separate clusters need a
separating rest between them.

Clusters do not produce MIDI output.

@strong{@i{Explicitly instantiating voices}}

The basic structure needed to achieve multiple independent
voices in a single staff is illustrated in the following example:

@lilypond[quote,relative=3,verbatim]
\new Staff <<
  \new Voice = "first"
    { \voiceOne r8 r16 g e8. f16 g8[ c,] f e16 d }
  \new Voice= "second"
    { \voiceTwo d16 c d8~ d16 b c8~ c16 b c8~ c16 b8. }
>>
@end lilypond

Here, voices are instantiated explicitly and are given names. The
@code{\voiceOne} ... @code{\voiceFour} commands set up the voices
so that first and third voices get stems up, second and fourth
voices get stems down, third and fourth voice note heads are
horizontally shifted, and rests in the respective voices are
automatically moved to avoid collisions.  The @code{\oneVoice}
command returns all the voice settings to the neutral default
directions.

@strong{@i{Temporary polyphonic passages}}

A temporary polyphonic passage can be created with the following
construct:

@example
<< @{ \voiceOne ... @}
  \new Voice @{ \voiceTwo ... @}
>> \oneVoice
@end example

Here, the first expression within a temporary polyphonic passage is
placed into the @code{Voice} context which was in use immediately
before the polyphonic passage, and that same @code{Voice} context
continues after the temporary section.  Other expressions within
the angle brackets are assigned to distinct temporary voices.
This allows lyrics to be assigned to one continuing voice before,
during and after a polyphonic section:

@lilypond[quote, verbatim, relative=2]
<<
  \new Voice = "melody" {
    a4
    <<
      {
        \voiceOne
        g f
      }
      \new Voice {
        \voiceTwo
        d2
      }
    >>
    \oneVoice
    e4
  }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "melody" {
  This is my song.
  }
>>
@end lilypond

Here, the @code{\voiceOne} and @code{\voiceTwo} commands are
required to define the settings of each voice.

@strong{@i{The double backslash construct}}

The @code{<< @{...@} \\ @{...@} >>} construct, where the two (or
more) expressions are separated by double backslashes, behaves
differently to the similar construct without the double backslashes:
@emph{all} the expressions within this contruct are assigned
to new @code{Voice} contexts.  These new @code{Voice} contexts
are created implicitly and are given the fixed names @code{"1"},
@code{"2"}, etc.

The first example could be typeset as follows:

@lilypond[quote,relative=3,verbatim]
<<
  { r8 r16 g e8. f16 g8[ c,] f e16 d }
  \\
  { d16 c d8~ d16 b c8~ c16 b c8~ c16 b8. }
>>
@end lilypond

This syntax can be used where it does not matter that temporary
voices are created and then discarded.  These implicitly created
voices are given the settings equivalent to the effect of the
@code{\voiceOne} ... @code{\voiceFour} commands, in the order in
which they appear in the code.

In the following example, the intermediate voice has stems up,
therefore we enter it in the third place, so it becomes voice
three, which has the stems up as desired.  Spacer rests are
used to avoid printing doubled rests.

@lilypond[quote,relative=3,verbatim]
<<
  { r8 g g  g g f16 ees f8 d }
  \\
  { ees,8 r ees r d r d r }
  \\
  { d'8 s c s bes s a s }
>>
@end lilypond

In all but the simplest works it is advisable to create explicit
@code{Voice} contexts as explained in @rlearning{Contexts and engravers} and
@rlearning{Explicitly instantiating voices}.

@strong{@i{Identical rhythms}}

In the special case that we want to typeset parallel pieces of music
that have the same rhythm, we can combine them into a single
@code{Voice} context, thus forming chords.  To achieve this, enclose
them in a simple simultaneous music construct within an explicit voice:

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
\new Voice <<
  { e4 f8 d e16 f g8 d4 }
  { c4 d8 b c16 d e8 b4 }
>>
@end lilypond

This method leads to strange beamings and warnings if the pieces of
music do not have the same rhythm.

The note heads of notes in different voices with the same pitch,
same note head and opposite stem direction are automatically
merged, but notes with different note heads or the same stem
direction are not.  Rests opposite a stem in a different voice
are shifted vertically.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]

    c8 d e d c d c4

  }

@end lilypond

Notes with different note heads may be merged, with the
exception of half-note heads and quarter-note heads:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
<<
  {
    \mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn
    c8 d e d c d c4

@end lilypond

Note heads with different dots may be merged:

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
<<

    \mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn
    \mergeDifferentlyDottedOn
    c8 d e d c d c4

  } \\ {
    \oneVoice
    s1
    e8 a b c d2
  }
>>
@end lilypond


The half note and eighth note at the start of the second measure
are incorrectly merged because @code{\mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn}
cannot successfully complete the merge when three or more notes
line up in the same column, and in this case a warning is given.
To allow the merge to work properly a @code{\shift} must be applied
to the note that should not be merged.  Here, @code{\shiftOn} is
applied to move the top @notation{g} out of the column, and
@code{\mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn} then works properly.

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
<<
  {
    \mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn
    \mergeDifferentlyDottedOn
    c8 d e d c d c4
    \shiftOn

@end lilypond

The @code{\shiftOn}, @code{\shiftOnn}, and @code{\shiftOnnn}
commands specify the degree to which chords of the current voice
should be shifted.  The outer voices (normally: voices one and
two) have @code{\shiftOff}, while the inner voices (three and
four) have @code{\shiftOn}.  @code{\shiftOnn} and
@code{\shiftOnnn} define further shift levels.

Notes are only merged if they have opposing stem directions (e.g. in
@code{Voice} 1 and 2).

@knownissues

When using @code{\mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn} with an upstem eighth
or a shorter note, and a downstem half note, the eighth note stem
gets a slightly wrong offset because of the different width of the
half note head symbol.

@ignore
@c TODO investigate! Sometimes it works, sometimes not. --FV
The requirements for successfully merging different note heads that
are at the same time differently dotted are not clear.
@end ignore

There is no support for chords where the same note occurs with
different accidentals in the same chord.  In this case, it is
recommended to use enharmonic transcription, or to use special
cluster notation (see @ref{Clusters}).

@unnumberedsubsubsec Automatic part combining

@cindex automatic part combining
@cindex part combiner
@cindex combining parts
@cindex a due part
@cindex solo part
@funindex \partcombine
@funindex partcombine

Automatic part combining is used to merge two parts of music onto
a staff.  It is aimed at typesetting orchestral scores.  When the
two parts are identical for a period of time, only one is shown.
In places where the two parts differ, they are typeset as separate
voices, and stem directions are set automatically.  Also, solo and
@notation{a due} parts are identified and marked by default.

The syntax for part combining is:

@example
\partcombine @var{musicexpr1} @var{musicexpr2}
@end example

The following example demonstrates the basic functionality of the
part combiner: putting parts on one staff and setting stem
directions and polyphony.  The same variables are used for the
independent parts and the combined staff.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
instrumentOne = \relative c' {
  c4 d e f
  R1
  d'4 c b a
  b4 g2 f4
  e1
}

instrumentTwo = \relative g' {
  R1
  g4 a b c
  d c b a
  g f( e) d
  e1
}

<<
  \new Staff \instrumentOne
  \new Staff \instrumentTwo
  \new Staff \partcombine \instrumentOne \instrumentTwo
>>
@end lilypond

The notes in the third measure appear only once, although they were
specified in both parts.  Stem, slur, and tie directions are set
automatically, depending whether there is a solo or unison.  When
needed in polyphony situations, the first part (with context called
@code{one}) always gets up stems, while the second (called @code{two})
always gets down stems.  In solo situations, the first and second
parts get marked with @q{Solo} and @q{Solo II}, respectively.  The
unisono (@notation{a due}) parts are marked by default with the text
@qq{a2}.

Both arguments to @code{\partcombine} will be interpreted as
@code{Voice} contexts.  If using relative octaves,
@code{\relative} should be specified for both music expressions,
i.e.,

@example
\partcombine
  \relative @dots{} @var{musicexpr1}
  \relative @dots{} @var{musicexpr2}
@end example

@noindent
A @code{\relative} section that is outside of @code{\partcombine}
has no effect on the pitches of @var{musicexpr1} and
@var{musicexpr2}.

@knownissues

@code{\partcombine} can only accept two voices.

When @code{printPartCombineTexts} is set, if the two voices play
the same notes on and off, the part combiner may typeset @code{a2}
more than once in a measure.

@code{\partcombine} cannot be inside @code{\times}.

@code{\partcombine} cannot be inside @code{\relative}.

Internally, the @code{\partcombine} interprets both arguments as
@code{Voice}s and decides when the parts can be combined.  When they have
different durations they cannot be combined and are given the names
@code{one} and @code{two}.  Consequently, if the arguments switch to
differently named @rinternals{Voice} contexts, the events in those will
be ignored.  Likewise, partcombining isn't designed to work with lyrics;
when one of the voices is explicitly named in order to attach lyrics to
it, the partcombining stops working.

@code{\partcombine} only observes onset times of notes. It cannot
determine whether a previously started note is playing or not, leading
to various problems.

Relative mode may be used.  Note that the @code{\relative} command
is not used inside @code{\parallelMusic} itself.  The notes are
relative to the preceding note in the voice, not to the previous

@code{voiceA} ignore the notes in @code{voiceB}.
