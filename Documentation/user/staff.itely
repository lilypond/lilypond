{staff-headword.ly}

Notes, dynamic signs, rests, etc., are grouped with a set of horizontal
lines, called a staff (plural @q{staves}).  In LilyPond, these
lines are drawn using a separate layout object called @code{staff
symbol}.

Two or more staves can be grouped vertically in a @code{GrandStaff}, a
@code{StaffGroup}, or a @code{ChoirStaff}.

Many scores consist of more than one staff.  These staves can be
grouped in several different ways:

@itemize
@item
In a @code{GrandStaff}, the group is started with a brace
at the left, and bar lines are connected between the staves. 

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,quote]
\new GrandStaff
\relative <<
  \new Staff { c1 c }
  \new Staff { c c }
>>
@end lilypond

@item
In a @code{StaffGroup}, the bar lines will be drawn through
all the staves, but the group is started with a bracket.

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,quote]
\new StaffGroup
\relative <<
  \new Staff { c1 c }
  \new Staff { c c }
>>
@end lilypond

@item
In a @code{ChoirStaff}, the group is started with a
bracket, but bar lines are not connected. 

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,quote]
\new ChoirStaff
\relative <<
  \new Staff { c1 c }
  \new Staff { c c }
>>
@end lilypond

@item
If no context is specified, the default properties for the score
will be used: the group is started with a vertical line, and the
bar lines are not connected.  

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,quote]
\relative <<
  \new Staff { c1 c }
  \new Staff { c c }
>>
@end lilypond
@end itemize

@cindex Mensurstriche layout
@cindex Renaissance music

In addition to these four staff group types, other groupings can
be produced by changing various properties. E.g., the
@q{Mensurstriche} layout common in Renaissance music, with
bar lines running between but not through the staves, can be
produced from a @code{StaffGroup} or @code{GrandStaff} context if
the bar lines are made transparent in the @code{Staff} itself, with
the command @code{\override Staff.BarLine #'transparent = ##t}

@cindex staff, nested

Staff groups can be nested, using the context
@code{InnerStaffGroup} or @code{InnerChoirStaff}; see
@lsr{staff,staff-brackets.ly}
@c snippet 137

@commonprop

More complex nesting can be accomplished using the property
@code{systemStartDelimiterHierarchy}: 

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
\new StaffGroup
\relative <<
  \set StaffGroup.systemStartDelimiterHierarchy
    = #'(SystemStartSquare (SystemStartBracket a
                             (SystemStartSquare b)) d)
  \new Staff { c1 }
  \new Staff { c1 }
  \new Staff { c1 }
  \new Staff { c1 }
  \new Staff { c1 }
>>
@end lilypond

Each staff group context sets the property
@code{systemStartDelimiter} to one of the values
@internalsref{SystemStartBar}, @internalsref{SystemStartBrace},
and @internalsref{SystemStartBracket}.  A fourth delimiter,
@code{systemStartSquare}, is also available, but must be
instantiated manually.

@c FIXME: Graham will deal with this.  -gp

@node Hiding staves
@unnumberedsubsubsec Hiding staves

@cindex Frenched scores
@cindex staves, hiding empty
@cindex hiding empty staves

In orchestral scores, staff lines that only have rests are usually
removed; this saves some space.  This style is called @q{French
Score}.  For @code{Lyrics}, @code{ChordNames} and
@code{FiguredBass}, this is switched on by default.  When
the lines of these contexts turn out empty after the line-breaking
process, they are removed.

For normal staves, a specialized @code{Staff} context is
available, which does the same: staves containing nothing (or only
multi-measure rests) are removed.  The context definition is
stored in @code{\RemoveEmptyStaffContext} variable.  Observe how
the second staff in this example disappears in the second line

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
\layout {
  \context { \RemoveEmptyStaffContext }
}

{
  \relative c' <<
    \new Staff { e4 f g a \break c1 }
    \new Staff { c4 d e f \break R1 }
  >>
}
@end lilypond

The first system shows all staves in full.  If empty staves should
be removed from the first system too, set @code{remove-first} to
true in @code{VerticalAxisGroup}.

@example
\override Score.VerticalAxisGroup #'remove-first = ##t
@end example

To remove other types of contexts, use
@code{\AncientRemoveEmptyStaffContext} or
@code{\RemoveEmptyRhythmicStaffContext}.

@cindex ossia

Another application of the @code{\RemoveEmptyStaffContext} is to
make ossia sections, i.e., alternative melodies on a separate
piece of staff, with help of a Frenched staff.  See @ref{Staff
symbol}. 

You can make the staff lines invisible by removing the
@code{Staff_symbol_engraver} from the @code{Staff} context.

  \context Staff \relative c'' { c8 c c16 c c c }

@refbugs

Collisions are not checked.  If you have notes above the top line
of the staff (or notes with articulations, slurs, text, etc), then
the metronome marking may be printed on top of musical symbols.
If this occurs, increase the padding of the metronome mark to
place it further away from the staff.

@example
\override Score.MetronomeMark #'padding = #2.5
@end example

@c perhaps also an example of how to move it horizontally?


@node Instrument names
@unnumberedsubsubsec Instrument names

@cindex instrument names
@cindex instrument names, short

In an orchestral score, instrument names are printed at the left
side of the staves.

This can be achieved by setting @code{Staff}.@code{instrumentName} and
@code{Staff}.@code{shortInstrumentName}, or
@code{PianoStaff}.@code{instrumentName} and
@code{PianoStaff}.@code{shortInstrumentName}.  This will print text
before the start of the staff.  For the first staff,
@code{instrumentName} is used.  If set, @code{shortInstrumentName} is
used for the following staves.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,ragged-right,relative=1,fragment]
\set Staff.instrumentName = "Ploink "
\set Staff.shortInstrumentName = "Plk "
c1
\break
c''
@end lilypond

You can also use markup texts to construct more complicated
instrument names, for example

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,ragged-right]
\set Staff.instrumentName = \markup {
  \column { "Clarinetti"
            \line { "in B" \smaller \flat } } }
c''1
@end lilypond

@cindex instrument names, centering
@cindex centering instrument names
@cindex aligning instrument names
@cindex instrument names, aligning

If you wish to center the instrument names, you must center all of
them individually:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,ragged-right]
{ <<
\new Staff {
  \set Staff.instrumentName = \markup {
    \center-align { "Clarinetti"
      \line { "in B" \smaller \flat } } }
  c''1
}
\new Staff {
  \set Staff.instrumentName =
       \markup{ \center-align { Vibraphone }}
  c''1
}
>>
}
@end lilypond

For longer instrument names, it may be useful to increase the
@code{indent} setting in the @code{\layout} block.

To center instrument names while leaving extra space to the right,

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,ragged-right]
\new StaffGroup \relative
<<
  \new Staff {
    \set Staff.instrumentName =
        \markup { \hcenter-in #10 "blabla" }
    c1 c1
  }
  \new Staff {
    \set Staff.instrumentName =
         \markup { \hcenter-in #10 "blo" }
    c1 c1
  }
>>
@end lilypond

To add instrument names to other contexts (such as
@code{GrandStaff}, @code{ChoirStaff}, or @code{StaffGroup}), the
engraver must be added to that context.

@example
\layout@{
  \context @{\GrandStaff \consists "Instrument_name_engraver"@}
@}
@end example

@noindent
More information about adding and removing engravers can be found
in @ref{Modifying context plug-ins}.

@cindex instrument names, changing

Instrument names may be changed in the middle of a piece,

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,ragged-right]
\set Staff.instrumentName = "First"
\set Staff.shortInstrumentName = "one"
c1 c c c \break
c1 c c c \break

With quotations, fragments of other parts can be inserted into a
part directly.  Before a part can be quoted, it must be marked
especially as quotable.  This is done with the @code{\addQuote}
command.

@example
\addQuote @var{name} @var{music}
@end example


@noindent
Here, @var{name} is an identifying string.  The @var{music} is any
kind of music.  Here is an example of @code{\addQuote}

@example
\addQuote clarinet \relative c' @{
  f4 fis g gis
@}
@end example

This command must be entered at toplevel, i.e., outside any music
blocks.  Typically, one would use an already defined music event
as the @var{music}:

@example
clarinet = \relative c' @{
  f4 fis g gis
@}
\addQuote clarinet @{ \clarinet @}
@end example


After calling @code{\addQuote}, the quotation may then be done
with @code{\quoteDuring} or @code{\cueDuring},

@example
\quoteDuring #@var{name} @var{music}
@end example

During a part, a piece of music can be quoted with the
@code{\quoteDuring} command.

@example
\quoteDuring #"clarinet" @{ s2. @}
@end example

This would cite three quarter notes (the duration of @code{s2.})
of the previously added @code{clarinet} voice.

More precisely, it takes the current time-step of the part being
printed, and extracts the notes at the corresponding point of the
@code{\addQuote}d voice.  Therefore, the argument to
@code{\addQuote} should be the entire part of the voice to be
quoted, including any rests at the beginning.

It is possible to use another music expression instead of
@code{s}, thus creating a polyphonic section, but this may not
always give the desired result.

Quotations take into account the transposition of both source and
target instruments, if they are specified using the
@code{\transposition} command.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
\addQuote clarinet \relative c' {
  \transposition bes
  f4 fis g gis
}

{
  e'8 f'8 \quoteDuring #"clarinet" { s2 }
}
@end lilypond

The type of events that are present in the quoted music can be
trimmed with the @code{quotedEventTypes} property.  The default
value is @code{(note-event rest-event)}, which means that only
notes and rests of the quoted voice end up in the
@code{\quoteDuring}.  Setting

@example
\set Staff.quotedEventTypes =
       #'(note-event articulation-event dynamic-event)
@end example

@noindent
will quote notes (but no rests), together with scripts and
dynamics.

@refbugs

Only the contents of the first @code{Voice} occurring in an
@code{\addQuote} command will be considered for quotation, so
@var{music} can not contain @code{\new} and @code{\context Voice}
statements that would switch to a different Voice.

Quoting grace notes is broken and can even cause LilyPond to
crash.

Quoting nested triplets may result in poor notation.

In earlier versions of LilyPond (pre 2.11), @code{addQuote} was
written entirely in lower-case letters: @code{\addquote}.

The previous section deals with inserting notes from another
voice.  There is a more advanced music function called
@code{\cueDuring}, which makes formatting cue notes easier.

The syntax is

@example
  \cueDuring #@var{name} #@var{updown} @var{music}
@end example

This will insert notes from the part @var{name} into a
@code{Voice} called @code{cue}.  This happens
simultaneously with @var{music}, which usually is a rest.  When
the cue notes start, the staff in effect becomes polyphonic for a
moment.  The argument @var{updown} determines whether the cue
notes should be notated as a first or second voice.

Here are a couple of hints for successful cue notes:

@itemize
@item
Cue notes have smaller font sizes.

@item
The cued part is marked with the instrument playing the cue.

@item
When the original part takes over again, this should be marked
with the name of the original instrument.

@item
Any other changes introduced by the cued part should also be
undone.  For example, if the cued instrument plays in a different
clef, the original clef should be stated once again.

@end itemize


The macro @code{\transposedCueDuring} is useful to add cues to
instruments which use a completely different octave range (for
example, having a cue of a piccolo flute within a contra bassoon
part).
