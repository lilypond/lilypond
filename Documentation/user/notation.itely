@node Notes
@subsection Notes


A note is printed by specifying its pitch and then its duration
@footnote{Notes constitute the most basic elements of LilyPond input,
but they do not form valid input on their own without a @code{\score}
block.  However, for the sake of brevity and simplicity we will
generally omit @code{\score} blocks and @code{\paper} declarations in
this manual.}

@node Pitches
@subsection Pitches

@cindex Pitch names
@cindex Note specification
@cindex pitches
@cindex entering notes

The most common syntax for pitch entry is used in @code{\chords} and
@code{\notes} mode.  In these modes, pitches may be designated by
names.  The notes are specified by the letters @code{a} through
@code{g}, while the octave is formed with notes ranging from @code{c}
to @code{b}.  The pitch @code{c} is an octave below middle C and the
letters span the octave above that C

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\clef bass
a,4 b, c d e f g a b c' d' e' \clef treble f' g' a' b' c''
@end lilypond

@cindex note names, Dutch

A sharp is formed by adding @code{-is} to the end of a pitch name and
a flat is formed by adding @code{-es}.  Double sharps and double flats
are obtained by adding @code{-isis} or @code{-eses}.  These
names are the Dutch note names.  In Dutch, @code{aes} is contracted to
@code{as}, but both forms are accepted. Similarly, both
@code{es} and @code{ees} are accepted.

Half-flats and half-sharps are formed by adding @code{-eh} and
@code{-ih}; the following is a series of Cs with increasing pitches

@cindex quarter tones
@cindex semi-flats, semi-sharps

There are predefined sets of note names for various other languages.
To use them,  include the language specific init file.  For
example: @code{\include "english.ly"}.  The available language files
and the note names they define are

@anchor{note name}
@anchor{note names}
@example

@end example 

@cindex @code{'}
@cindex @code{,}



The optional octave specification takes the form of a series of
single quote (`@code{'}') characters or a series of comma
(`@code{,}') characters.  Each @code{'} raises the pitch by one
octave; each @code{,} lowers the pitch by an octave

@node Chromatic alterations
@subsection Chromatic alterations

Normally accidentals are printed automatically, but you may also
print them manually.  A reminder accidental
@cindex reminder accidental
@cindex @code{?}
can be forced by adding an exclamation mark @code{!}
after the pitch.  A cautionary accidental
@cindex cautionary accidental
@cindex parenthesized accidental
(i.e. an accidental within parentheses) can be obtained by adding the
question mark `@code{?}' after the pitch

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
cis' cis' cis'! cis'?
@end lilypond


@seealso

The automatic production of accidentals can be tuned in many
ways. For more information, refer to @ref{Accidentals}.


@refbugs

There are no generally accepted standards for denoting three quarter
flats, so LilyPond's symbol does not conform to any standard.

@node Chords
@subsection Chords

A chord is formed by a enclosing a set of pitches in @code{<} and
@code{>}. A chord may be followed by  a duration, and a set of
articulations, just like simple notes.

@lilypond[quote,relative=1]

@node Rests
@subsection Rests
@cindex Rests




Rests are entered like notes, with the note name @code{r}

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
r1 r2 r4 r8
@end lilypond

Whole bar rests, centered in middle of the bar,
must be done  with multi-measure rests. They are discussed in
@ref{Multi measure rests}.


A rest's vertical position may be explicitly specified by entering a
note with the @code{\rest} keyword appended. This makes manual
formatting in polyphonic music easier.  Rest collision testing will
leave these rests alone

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
a'4\rest d'4\rest
@end lilypond

@seealso

Program reference: @internalsref{RestEvent}, and @internalsref{Rest}.


@c FIXME: naming.
@node Skips
@subsection Skips
@cindex Skip
@cindex Invisible rest
@cindex Space note

An invisible rest (also called a `skip') can be entered like a note
with note name `@code{s}' or with @code{\skip @var{duration}}

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
a2 s4 a4 \skip 1 a4 
@end lilypond

The @code{s} syntax is only available in note mode and chord mode.  In
other situations, you should use the @code{\skip} command

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
\score {
  \new Staff <<
    { \time 4/8 \skip 2 \time 4/4 } 
    \notes\relative c'' { a2 a1 }
  >>
}
@end lilypond

The skip command is merely an empty musical placeholder.  It does not
produce any output, not even transparent output.

The @code{s} skip command does create @internalsref{Staff} and
@internalsref{Voice} when necessary, similar to note and rest
commands. For example, the following results in an empty staff.

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
\score { \notes { s4 } } 
@end lilypond

The same fragment using @code{\skip} results in an empty page.

@seealso

Program reference: @internalsref{SkipEvent}, @internalsref{SkipMusic}.



@node Durations
@subsection Durations


@cindex duration


In Note, Chord, and Lyrics mode, durations are designated by numbers
and dots: durations are entered as their reciprocal values.  For example,
a quarter note is entered using a @code{4} (since it is a 1/4 note), while
a half note is entered using a @code{2} (since it is a 1/2 note).  For notes
longer than a whole you must use variables

@example 
c'\breve  
c'1 c'2 c'4 c'8 c'16 c'32 c'64 c'64 
r\longa r\breve  
r1 r2 r4 r8 r16 r32 r64 r64 
@end example 

@lilypond[quote]
\score {
  \notes \relative c'' {
    a\breve*1/2  \autoBeamOff
    a1 a2 a4 a8 a16 a32 a64 a64 
    r\longa*1/4 r\breve  *1/2
    r1 r2 r4 r8 r16 r32 r64 r64 
  }
  \paper {
    raggedright = ##t
    \context {
      \StaffContext
        \remove "Clef_engraver"
        \override StaffSymbol #'transparent = ##t 
        \override TimeSignature #'transparent = ##t
        \override BarLine #'transparent = ##t
        \consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond


If the duration is omitted then it is set to the previously entered
duration. The default for the first note is a quarter note.  The duration
can be followed by dots (`@code{.}') in order to obtain dotted note
lengths
@cindex @code{.}

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
a' b' c''8 b' a'4 a'4. b'4.. c'8.
@end lilypond
@cindex @code{r}
@cindex @code{s}

You can alter the length of duration by a fraction @var{N/M}
appending `@code{*}@var{N/M}' (or `@code{*}@var{N}' if @var{M=1}). This
will not affect the appearance of the notes or rests produced.

In the following example, the first three notes take up exactly two
beats, but no triplet bracket is printed.
@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=3,verbatim]
\time 2/4
a4*2/3 gis4*2/3 a4*2/3
a4
@end lilypond

@refcommands

Dots are normally moved up to avoid staff lines, except in polyphonic
situations. The following commands may be used to force a particular
direction manually

@cindex @code{\dotsUp}
@code{\dotsUp}, 
@cindex @code{\dotsDown}
@code{\dotsDown}, 
@cindex @code{\dotsBoth}
@code{\dotsBoth}.

Program reference: @internalsref{Dots}, and @internalsref{DotColumn}. 

@node Stems
@subsection Stems

Whenever a note is found, a @internalsref{Stem} object is created
automatically. For whole notes and rests, they are also created but
made invisible.

@refcommands

@cindex @code{\stemUp}
@code{\stemUp}, 
@cindex @code{\stemDown}

@node Ties
@subsection Ties

@cindex Tie
@cindex ties
@cindex @code{~}

A tie connects two adjacent note heads of the same pitch.  The tie in
effect extends the length of a note.  Ties should not be confused with
slurs, which indicate articulation, or phrasing slurs, which indicate
musical phrasing.  A tie is entered using the tilde symbol `@code{~}'

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
e' ~ e' <c' e' g'> ~ <c' e' g'>
@end lilypond

When a tie is applied to a chord, all note heads whose pitches match
are connected.  When no note heads match, no ties will be created.

In its meaning a tie is just a way of extending a note duration, similar
to the augmentation dot; in the following example there are two ways of 
notating exactly the same concept
@c
@lilypond[quote,fragment,raggedright]
\time 3/4 c'2. c'2 ~ c'4
@end lilypond
If you need to tie a lot of  notes over bars, it may be easier to use automatic
note splitting (see @ref{Automatic note splitting}).

For tying only a subset of the note heads of a pair of chords, see
@inputfileref{input/regression,tie-chord-partial.ly}.

@refbugs


Switching staves when a tie is active will not produce a slanted tie.

Formatting of ties is a difficult subject. The results are often not
optimal.



@node Tuplets
@subsection Tuplets

@cindex tuplets
@cindex triplets
@cindex @code{\times}

Tuplets are made out of a music expression by multiplying all durations
with a fraction

@cindex @code{\times}
@example
\times @var{fraction} @var{musicexpr}
@end example

@noindent
The duration of @var{musicexpr} will be multiplied by the fraction.
The fraction's denominator will be printed over the notes, optionally
with a bracket.  The most common tuplet is the triplet in which 3
notes have the length of 2, so the notes are 2/3 of their written
length

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
g'4 \times 2/3 {c'4 c' c'} d'4 d'4
@end lilypond

The property @code{tupletSpannerDuration} specifies how long each
bracket should last.  With this, you can make lots of tuplets while
typing @code{\times} only once, saving lots of typing. In the next
example, there are two triplets shown, while @code{\times} was only
used once

@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=1,raggedright,verbatim]
\set tupletSpannerDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1 4)
\times 2/3 { c'8 c c c c c }
@end lilypond

The format of the number is determined by the property
@code{tupletNumberFormatFunction}.  The default prints only the
denominator, but if it is set to the Scheme function
@code{fraction-tuplet-formatter}, @var{num}:@var{den} will be printed
instead.

@inputfileref{input/regression,tuplet-nest.ly}.



@node Easier music entry
@section Easier music entry
@cindex Music entry

This section deals with tricks and features of the input language that
were added solely to help entering music, finding and correcting
mistakes.  There are also external tools that make debugging easier.

@node Relative octaves
@subsection Relative octaves
@cindex Relative
@cindex relative octave specification

Octaves are specified by adding @code{'} and @code{,} to pitch names.
When you copy existing music, it is easy to accidentally put a pitch
in the wrong octave and hard to find such an error. The relative
octave mode prevents these errors: a single error puts the rest of the
piece off by one octave

@cindex @code{\relative}
@example
  \relative @var{startpitch} @var{musicexpr}
@end example

The octave of notes that appear in @var{musicexpr} are calculated as
follows: If no octave changing marks are used, the basic interval
between this and the last note is always taken to be a fourth or
less. This distance is determined without regarding alterations; a
@code{fisis} following a @code{ceses} will be put above the
@code{ceses}.

The octave changing marks @code{'} and @code{,} can be added to raise
or lower the pitch by an extra octave.  Upon entering relative mode,
an absolute starting pitch must be specified that will act as the
predecessor of the first note of @var{musicexpr}.

Here is the relative mode shown in action
@lilypond[quote,fragment,raggedright,verbatim]
\relative c'' {
  b c d c b c bes a 
}
@end lilypond

Octave changing marks are used for intervals greater than a fourth
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\relative c'' {
  c g c f, c' a, e''
}
@end lilypond

If the preceding item is a chord, the first note of the chord is used
to determine the first note of the next chord

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\relative c' {
  c <c e g> 
  <c' e g>
  <c, e' g>
}
@end lilypond
@cindex @code{\notes}

The pitch after the @code{\relative} contains a note name.  To parse
the note name as a pitch, it must surrounded by @code{\notes}

The relative conversion will not affect @code{\transpose},
@code{\chords} or @code{\relative} sections in its argument.  If you
want to use relative within transposed music, you must place an
additional @code{\relative} inside the @code{\transpose}.

@node Octave check
@subsection Octave check


Octave checks make octave errors easier to correct:  a note may be
followed by @code{=}@var{quotes} which indicates what its absolute
octave should be.  In the following example,
@example
\relative c'' @{ c='' b=' d,='' @}        
@end example

@noindent
@c take care with @code, adds confusing quotes.
the d will generate a warning, because a d'' is expected, but a d' is
found.  In the output, the octave is corrected for this and the
following notes.



There is also a syntax that is separate from the notes.
@example
\octave @var{pitch}
@end example

This checks that @var{pitch} (without octave) yields @var{pitch} (with
octave) in \relative mode. If not, a warning is printed, and the
octave is corrected, for example, the first check is passed
successfully.  The second check fails with an error message.  The
octave is adjusted so the following notes are in the correct octave
once again.
@example
\relative c' @{
  e
  \octave a'
  \octave b'
@}
@end example


The octave of a note following an octave check is determined with
respect to the note preceding it. In the next fragment, the last note
is a @code{a'}, above middle C. Hence, the @code{\octave} check may
be deleted without changing the meaning of the piece.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment] 
\relative c' {
  e
  \octave b
  a        
}
@end lilypond

@node Bar check
@subsection Bar check
@cindex Bar check

@cindex bar check
@cindex @code{barCheckSynchronize}
@cindex @code{|}

Bar checks help detect errors in the durations.  A bar check is
entered using the bar symbol, `@code{|}'.  Whenever it is encountered
during interpretation, it should fall on a measure boundary.  If it
does not, a warning is printed.  In the next example, the second bar
check will signal an error
@example
\time 3/4 c2 e4 | g2 | 
@end example

Bar checks can also be used in lyrics, for example 

@example
\lyrics @{
  \time 2/4
  Twin -- kle | Twin -- kle
@} 
@end example


@cindex skipTypesetting

Failed bar checks are caused by entering incorrect
durations. Incorrect durations often completely garble up the score,
especially if it is polyphonic, so you should start correcting the
score by scanning for failed bar checks and incorrect durations.  To
speed up this process, you can use @code{skipTypesetting}, described
in the next section.

@node Skipping corrected music
@subsection Skipping corrected music

The property @code{Score.skipTypesetting} can be used to switch on and
off typesetting completely during the interpretation phase. When
typesetting is switched off, the music is processed much more quickly.
This can be used to skip over the parts of a score that have already
been checked for errors

@lilypond[quote,fragment,raggedright,verbatim]
\relative c'' {
  c8 d
  \set Score.skipTypesetting = ##t
  e f g a g c, f e d
  \set Score.skipTypesetting = ##f
  c d b bes a g c2 }
@end lilypond

@node Automatic note splitting
@subsection Automatic note splitting

Long notes can be converted automatically to tied notes.  This is done
by replacing the @internalsref{Note_heads_engraver} by the
@internalsref{Completion_heads_engraver}.
In the following examples, notes crossing the bar line are split and tied.


@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=1,raggedright]
\new Voice \with {
  \remove "Note_heads_engraver"
  \consists "Completion_heads_engraver"
} {
  c2. c8 d4 e f g a b c8 c2 b4 a g16 f4 e d c8. c2 
}
@end lilypond

This engraver splits all running notes at the bar line, and inserts
ties.  One of its uses is to debug complex scores: if the measures are
not entirely filled, then the ties exactly show how much each measure
is off.

@refbugs

Not all durations (especially those containing tuplets) can be
represented exactly; the engraver will not insert tuplets.

@refbugs

If a staff is ended halfway a piece, the staff symbol may not end

@node Key signature
@subsection Key signature
@cindex Key signature

@cindex @code{\key}

The key signature indicates the scale in which a piece is played. It
is denoted by a set of alterations (flats or sharps) at the start of
the staff.


Setting or changing the key signature is done with the @code{\key}
command
@example
  @code{\key} @var{pitch} @var{type}
@end example

@cindex @code{\minor}
@cindex @code{\major}
@cindex @code{\minor}
@cindex @code{\ionian}
@cindex @code{\locrian}
@cindex @code{\aeolian}
@cindex @code{\mixolydian}
@cindex @code{\lydian}
@cindex @code{\phrygian}
@cindex @code{\dorian}

Here, @var{type} should be @code{\major} or @code{\minor} to get
@var{pitch}-major or @var{pitch}-minor, respectively.
The standard mode names @code{\ionian},
@code{\locrian}, @code{\aeolian}, @code{\mixolydian}, @code{\lydian},
@code{\phrygian}, and @code{\dorian} are also defined.

This command sets the context property
@internalsref{Staff}.@code{keySignature}.  Non-standard key signatures
can be specified by setting this property directly.

Accidentals and key signatures often confuse new users, because
unaltered notes get natural signs depending on the key signature. For
more information,   see  @ref{More about pitches}.

@refbugs

The ordering of a key cancellation is wrong when it is combined with
repeat bar lines. The cancellation is also printed after a line break.

The clef can be set or changed with the @code{\clef} command

By adding @code{_8} or @code{^8} to the clef name, the clef is
transposed one octave down or up, respectively, and @code{_15} and
@code{^15} transposes by two octaves.  The argument @var{clefname}
must be enclosed in quotes when it contains underscores or digits. For
example,


@cindex choral tenor clef  
@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,relative=1]
\clef "G_8" c4
@end lilypond

This command is equivalent to setting @code{clefGlyph},
@code{clefPosition} (which controls the Y position of the clef),
@code{centralCPosition} and @code{clefOctavation}. A clef is printed
when any of these properties are changed.

Program reference: the object for this symbol is @internalsref{Clef}.



@node Ottava brackets
@subsection Ottava brackets

``Ottava'' brackets introduce an extra transposition of an octave for
the staff. They are created by invoking the function
@code{set-octavation}

@cindex ottava
@cindex 15ma
@cindex octavation

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\relative c''' {
  a2 b
  #(set-octavation 1)
  a b 
  #(set-octavation 0)
  a b
}
@end lilypond

The @code{set-octavation} function also takes -1 (for 8va bassa) and 2
(for 15ma) as arguments.  Internally the function sets the properties
@code{ottavation} (e.g. to @code{"8va"}) and
@code{centralCPosition}. For overriding the text of the bracket, set
@code{ottavation} after invoking @code{set-octavation}, i.e.,

@example
#(set-octavation 1)
\set Staff.ottavation = #"8"
@end example

@seealso

Program reference: @internalsref{OttavaBracket}.

Examples: @inputfileref{input/regression,ottava.ly},

@code{set-octavation} will get confused when clef changes happen
during an octavation bracket.

@node Time signature
@subsection Time signature
@cindex Time signature
@cindex meter
@cindex @code{\time}

Time signature indicates the metrum of a piece: a regular pattern of
strong and weak beats. It is denoted by a fraction at the start of the
staff.


The time signature is set or changed by the @code{\time}
command
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\time 2/4 c'2 \time 3/4 c'2. 
@end lilypond

The symbol that is printed can be customized with the @code{style}
property. Setting it to @code{#'()} uses fraction style for 4/4 and
2/2 time.  There are many more options for its layout.  See
@inputfileref{input/test,time.ly} for more examples.


This command sets the property @code{timeSignatureFraction},
@code{beatLength} and @code{measureLength} in the @code{Timing}
context, which is normally aliased to @internalsref{Score}.  The
property @code{measureLength} determines where bar lines should be
inserted, and how automatic beams should be generated.  Changing the
value of @code{timeSignatureFraction} also causes the symbol to be
printed.

More options are available through the Scheme function
@code{set-time-signature}. In combination with the
@internalsref{Measure_grouping_engraver}, it will create
@internalsref{MeasureGrouping} signs. Such signs ease reading
rhythmically complex modern music.  In the following example, the 9/8
measure is subdivided in 2, 2, 2 and 3. This is passed to
@code{set-time-signature} as the third argument @code{(2 2 2 3)}

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
\score {
  \notes \relative c'' {
    #(set-time-signature 9 8 '(2 2 2 3))

Bar lines and bar numbers are calculated automatically. For unmetered
music (e.g. cadenzas), this is not desirable.  By setting
@code{Score.timing} to false, this automatic timing can be switched
off. Empty bar lines,

@example

Bar lines delimit measures, but are also used to indicate repeats.
Normally, they are inserted automatically.  Line breaks may only
happen on bar lines.

Special types of bar lines can be forced with the @code{\bar} command
@c
@lilypond[quote,relative=2,fragment,verbatim]
c4 \bar "|:" c4
@end lilypond

The following bar types are available
@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=1,raggedright,verbatim]

\bar "" c
\bar "|:" c
\bar "||" c
\bar ":|" c
\bar ".|" c
\bar ".|." c
\bar ":|:" c
\bar "|." c
\bar ":" c
@end lilypond
For allowing line breaks, there is a special command,
@example
  \bar "empty"
@end example 
This will insert an invisible bar line, and allow line breaks at this
point.

In scores with many staves, a @code{\bar} command in one staff is
automatically applied to all staves. The resulting bar lines are
connected between different staves of a @internalsref{StaffGroup}
@c
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
<<
  \context StaffGroup <<
    \new Staff {
      e'4 d'
      \bar "||"
      f' e'
    }
    \new Staff { \clef bass c4 g e g }
  >>
  \new Staff { \clef bass c2 c2 }
>>
@end lilypond

A bar line is created whenever the @code{whichBar} property is set.
At the start of a measure it is set to the contents of
@code{defaultBarType}. The contents of @code{repeatCommands} are used
to override default measure bars.

The command @code{\bar }@var{bartype} is a short cut for doing
@code{\set Timing.whichBar = }@var{bartype}.  Whenever @code{whichBar}
is set to a string, a bar line of that type is created.

@cindex whichBar

@cindex bar lines at start of system
@cindex start of system

The bar lines at the start of each system are

@node Polyphony
@section Polyphony
@cindex polyphony

The easiest way to enter fragments with more than one voice on a staff
is to split chords using the separator @code{\\}.  You can use it for
small, short-lived voices or for single chords

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\context Staff \relative c'' {
  c4 << { f d e  } \\ { b c2 } >>
  c4 << g' \\ b, \\  f' \\ d >>
}
@end lilypond

The separator causes @internalsref{Voice} contexts@footnote{Polyphonic
voices are sometimes called "layers" other notation packages}
@cindex layers
to be instantiated. They bear the names @code{"1"}, @code{"2"}, etc. In
each of these contexts, vertical direction of slurs, stems, etc. is set
appropriately.

@cindex @code{\voiceOne}
@cindex @code{\voiceFour}

This can also be done by instantiating @internalsref{Voice} contexts
by hand, and using @code{\voiceOne}, up to @code{\voiceFour} to assign
a stem directions and horizontal shift for each part
@c

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
\relative c''
\context Staff <<
  \new Voice { \voiceOne cis2 b  }
  \new Voice { \voiceThree b4 ais ~ ais4 gis4 } 
  \new Voice { \voiceTwo fis4~  fis4 f ~ f  } >>
@end lilypond

@noindent
The command @code{\oneVoice} will revert back to the normal setting.
@cindex @code{\oneVoice}


Normally, note heads with a different number of dots are not merged, but
when  the object property @code{merge-differently-dotted} is set in
the @internalsref{NoteCollision} object, they are merged
@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,raggedright,relative=2]
\context Voice << {
  g8 g8 
  \override Staff.NoteCollision  
    #'merge-differently-dotted = ##t
  g8 g8
} \\ { g8.[ f16] g8.[ f16] } >>
@end lilypond

Similarly, you can merge half note heads with eighth notes, by setting
@code{merge-differently-headed}
@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=2,verbatim]
\context Voice << {
  c8 c4.
  \override Staff.NoteCollision
    #'merge-differently-headed = ##t
c8 c4. } \\ { c2 c2 } >>

@refbugs

Resolving collisions is a intricate subject, and only a few situations
are handled. When LilyPond cannot cope, the @code{force-hshift}
property of the @internalsref{NoteColumn} object and pitched rests can
be used to override typesetting decisions.

When using @code{merge-differently-headed} with an upstem eighth or a
shorter note, and a downstem half note, the eighth note gets the wrong
offset.

There is no support for clusters where the same note occurs with
different accidentals in the same chord. In this case, it is
recommended to use enharmonic transcription, or to use special cluster
notation (see @ref{Clusters}).

@node Beaming
@section Beaming

Beams are used to group short notes into chunks that are aligned with
the metrum. They are inserted automatically

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\time 2/4 c8 c c c \time 6/8 c c c c8. c16  c8
@end lilypond

When these automatic decisions are not good enough, beaming can be
entered explicitly. It is also possible to define beaming patterns
that differ from the defaults.

Individual notes may be marked with @code{\noBeam}, to prevent them
from being beamed

is erased

@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=1,verbatim]

@cindex tuning automatic beaming

@c [TODO: use \applycontext]

In normal time signatures, automatic beams can start on any note but can
only end in a few positions within the measure: beams can end on a beat,
or at durations specified by the properties in
@code{autoBeamSettings}. The defaults for @code{autoBeamSettings}
are defined in @file{scm/auto-beam.scm}.

The value of @code{autoBeamSettings} is changed with two functions,
@example
  #(override-auto-beam-setting
     '(@var{be} @var{p} @var{q} @var{n} @var{m}) @var{a} @var{b}
     [@var{context}])
  #(revert-auto-beam-setting '(@var{be} @var{p} @var{q} @var{n} @var{m}))
@end example
Here, @var{be} is the symbol @code{begin} or @code{end}, and
@var{context} is an optional context (default: @code{'Voice}). It
determines whether the rule applies to begin or end-points.  The
quantity @var{p}/@var{q} refers to the length of the beamed notes (and
`@code{* *}' designates notes of any length), @var{n}/@var{M} refers
to a time signature (wildcards `@code{* *}' may be entered to
designate all time signatures), @var{a}/@var{b} is a duration.  By
default, this command changes settings for the current voice. It is
also possible to adjust settings at higher contexts, by adding a
@var{context} argument.

For example, if automatic beams should end on every quarter note, use
the following
@example
   #(override-auto-beam-setting '(end * * * *) 1 4 'Staff)
@end example
Since the duration of a quarter note is 1/4 of a whole note, it is
entered as @code{(ly:make-moment 1 4)}.

The same syntax can be used to specify beam starting points. In this
example, automatic beams can only end on a dotted quarter note
@example
   #(override-auto-beam-setting '(end * * * *) 3 8)
@end example
In 4/4 time signature, this means that automatic beams could end only on
3/8 and on the fourth beat of the measure (after 3/4, that is 2 times
3/8, has passed within the measure).

Rules can also be restricted to specific time signatures. A rule that
should only be applied in @var{N}/@var{M} time signature is formed by
replacing the second asterisks by @var{N} and @var{M}. For example, a
rule for 6/8 time exclusively looks like
@example
 #(override-auto-beam-setting '(begin * * 6 8) @dots{})
@end example

If a rule should be to applied only to certain types of beams, use the
first pair of asterisks. Beams are classified according to the
shortest note they contain. For a beam ending rule that only applies
to beams with 32nd notes (and no shorter notes), use @code{(end 1 32 *
*)}.

@cindex automatic beam generation
@cindex autobeam
@cindex @code{autoBeaming}
@cindex lyrics

If beams are used to indicate melismata in songs, then automatic
beaming should be switched off. This is done by setting
@code{autoBeaming} to @code{#f}.

@refcommands

@code{\autoBeamOff}, 
@cindex @code{\autoBeamOn}

@refbugs

If a score ends while an automatic beam has not been ended and is
still accepting notes, this last beam will not be typeset at all. The
same holds polyphonic voices, entered with @code{<< @dots{} \\ @dots{}
>>}. If a polyphonic voice ends while an automatic beam is still
accepting notes, it is not typeset.

The rules for ending a beam depend on the shortest note in a beam.
So, while it is possible to have different ending rules for eight
beams and sixteenth beams, a beam that contains both eight and
sixteenth notes will use the rules for the sixteenth beam.

In the example below, the autobeamer makes eight beams and sixteenth
end at 3 eights; the third beam can only be corrected by specifying
manual beaming.

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,fragment,relative=1]

@end lilypond
It is not possible to specify beaming parameters that act differently in
different parts of a measure. This means that it is not possible to use
automatic beaming in irregular meters such as @code{5/8}.

@node Accidentals
@section Accidentals
@cindex Accidentals

This section describes how to change the way that accidentals are
inserted automatically before the running notes.

Common rules for typesetting accidentals have been canned in a
function. This function is called as follows

@cindex @code{set-accidental-style}
@example
  #(set-accidental-style 'modern 'Voice)
@end example

The function takes two arguments: a symbol that denotes the style (in
the example, @code{modern}), and another symbol that denotes the
context name (in this example, @code{Voice}). If no context name is
supplied, @code{Staff} is the default.

The following styles are supported
@table @code
@item default
      This is the default typesetting behavior. It should correspond
      to 18th century common practice: Accidentals are
      remembered to the end of the measure in which they occur and
      only on their own octave.

@item voice
@c
      The normal behavior is to remember the accidentals on
Staff-level.  This variable, however, typesets accidentals
individually for each voice.  Apart from that, the rule is similar to
@code{code}.

      This leads to some weird and often unwanted results
      because accidentals from one voice do not get canceled in other
      voices
@lilypond[quote,raggedright,relative=1,fragment,verbatim]
\context Staff <<
  #(set-accidental-style 'voice)
  <<
    { es g } \\
    { c, e }
>> >>
@end lilypond
      Hence you should only use @code{voice} if the voices
are to be read solely by individual musicians. If the staff is to be
used by one musician (e.g. a conductor) then you use
@code{modern} or @code{modern-cautionary}
instead.

@item modern
@cindex @code{modern} style accidentals
      This rule  corresponds to the common practice in the 20th
      century.
      This rule prints the same accidentals as @code{default},  but temporary
      accidentals also are canceled in other octaves. Furthermore,
      in the same octave, they also get canceled in the following
      measure

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,fragment,verbatim]
#(set-accidental-style 'modern)
cis' c'' cis'2 | c'' c'
@end lilypond

@item @code{modern-cautionary}
      @cindex @code{modern-cautionary}
     This rule is similar to @code{modern}, but the
     ``extra'' accidentals (the ones not typeset by
     @code{default}) are typeset as cautionary accidentals.
     They are printed in reduced size or with parentheses
@lilypond[quote,raggedright,fragment,verbatim]
#(set-accidental-style 'modern-cautionary)
cis' c'' cis'2 | c'' c'
@end lilypond

      @cindex @code{modern-voice}
@item modern-voice
This rule is used for multivoice accidentals to be read both by musicians
playing one voice and musicians playing all voices.  Accidentals are
typeset for each voice, but they @emph{are} canceled across voices in
the same @internalsref{Staff}.

      @cindex @code{modern-voice-cautionary}
@item modern-voice-cautionary
This rule is the same as @code{modern-voice}, but with the extra
accidentals (the ones not typeset by @code{voice}) typeset
as cautionaries.  Even though all accidentals typeset by
@code{default} @emph{are} typeset by this variable then
some of them are typeset as cautionaries.

@item piano
      @cindex @code{piano} accidentals
This rule reflects      20th century practice for piano notation. Very similar to
      @code{modern} but accidentals also get canceled
      across the staves in the same @internalsref{GrandStaff} or
      @internalsref{PianoStaff}.

@item piano-cautionary
      @cindex @code{#(set-accidental-style 'piano-cautionary)}
      As @code{#(set-accidental-style 'piano)' , str)} but with the extra accidentals
      typeset as cautionaries.

@item no-reset
      @cindex @code{no-reset} accidental style
      @c
      This is the same as @code{default} but with accidentals lasting
      ``forever'' and not only until the next measure
@lilypond[quote,raggedright,fragment,verbatim,relative=1]
#(set-accidental-style 'no-reset)
c1 cis cis c
@end lilypond

@item forget
      This is sort of the opposite of @code{no-reset}: Accidentals
      are not remembered at all---and hence all accidentals are
      typeset relative to the key signature, regardless of what was
      before in the music
      
@lilypond[quote,raggedright,fragment,verbatim,relative=1]
#(set-accidental-style 'forget)

Program reference: @internalsref{Accidental_engraver},

@refbugs

Simultaneous notes are considered to be entered in sequential
mode. This means that in a chord the accidentals are typeset as if the
notes in the chord happened once at a time - in the order in which
they appear in the input file.

This is only a problem when accidentals in a chord depend on each
other.  This problem can be solved by manually inserting @code{!} and
@code{?}  for the problematic notes.

In the default scheme, accidentals only depend on other
accidentals with the same pitch on the same staff, so no conflicts are
possible.

@node Slurs
@subsection Slurs
@cindex Slurs

A slur indicates that notes are to be played bound or @emph{legato}.


They are entered using parentheses
@lilypond[quote,relative=2,fragment,verbatim]
f( g)( a) a8 b( a4 g2 f4)
<c e>2( <b d>2)
@end lilypond


@c TODO: should explain that ^( and _( set directions
@c should set attachments with ^ and _ ?  

Slurs avoid crossing stems, and are generally attached to note heads.
However, in some situations with beams, slurs may be attached to stem
ends.  If you want to override this layout you can do this through the
object property @code{attachment} of @internalsref{Slur}.  Its value
is a pair of symbols, specifying the attachment type of the left and
right end points

@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=1,verbatim]
\slurUp
\override Stem #'length = #5.5
g'8(g g4)
\override Slur #'attachment = #'(stem . stem)
g8( g g4)
@end lilypond

If a slur would strike through a stem or beam, the slur will be moved
away upward or downward. If this happens, attaching the slur to the
stems might look better

@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=1,verbatim]
\stemUp \slurUp
d32( d'4 d8..)
\override Slur #'attachment = #'(stem . stem)

@node Phrasing slurs
@subsection Phrasing slurs

@cindex phrasing slurs
@cindex phrasing marks

A phrasing slur (or phrasing mark) connects chords and is used to
indicate a musical sentence. It is started using @code{\(} and @code{\)}
respectively

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=1]
\time 6/4 c'\( d( e) f( e)  d\) 
@end lilypond

Typographically, the phrasing slur behaves almost exactly like a
normal slur.  However, they are treated as different objects.  A
@code{\slurUp} will have no effect on a phrasing slur; instead, you
should use @code{\phrasingSlurUp}, @code{\phrasingSlurDown}, and
@code{\phrasingSlurBoth}.

The commands @code{\slurUp}, @code{\slurDown}, and @code{\slurBoth}
will only affect normal slurs and not phrasing slurs.

@code{\startTextSpan} and @code{\stopTextSpan} to the
start and ending note of the spanner. 

The string to be printed, as well as the style, is set through object
properties

@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=1,verbatim]

To use this, add the @internalsref{Horizontal_bracket_engraver} to
@internalsref{Staff} context.  A bracket is started with
@code{\startGroup} and closed with @code{\stopGroup}

@cindex articulations
@cindex scripts
@cindex ornaments

A variety of symbols can appear above and below notes to indicate
different characteristics of the performance. They are added to a note
by adding a dash and  the character signifying the
articulation. They are demonstrated here

@lilypondfile[quote,raggedright]{script-abbreviations.ly}

The meanings of these shorthands can be changed. See
@file{ly/script-init.ly} for examples.


The script is automatically placed, but if you need to force
directions, you can use @code{_} to force them down, or @code{^} to
put them up
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]

@end lilypond

Other symbols can be added using the syntax
@var{note}@code{\}@var{name}, e.g. @code{c4\fermata}. Again, they

@node Grace notes
@subsection Grace notes


@c should have blurb about accaciatura / appogiatura

@cindex @code{\grace}
@cindex ornaments
@cindex grace notes

Grace notes are ornaments that are written out.  The most common ones
are acciaccatura, which should be played as very short.  It is denoted
by a slurred small note with a slashed stem.  The appoggiatura is a
grace note that takes a fixed fraction of the main note, is and
denoted as a slurred note in small print without a slash.
They are entered with the commands @code{\acciaccatura} and
@code{\appoggiatura}, as demonstrated in the following example


@cindex appoggiatura
@cindex acciaccatura

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim,fragment]
b4 \acciaccatura d8 c4 \appoggiatura e8 d4
\acciaccatura { g16[ f] } e4
@end lilypond

Both are special forms of the @code{\grace} command. By prefixing this
keyword to a music expression, a new one is formed, which will be
printed in a smaller font and takes up no logical time in a measure.

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim,fragment]
c4 \grace c16 c4
\grace { c16[ d16] } c2 c4
@end lilypond

@noindent
Unlike @code{\acciaccatura} and @code{\appoggiatura}, the
@code{\grace} command does not start a slur.

Internally, timing for grace notes is done using a second, `grace'
time. Every point in time consists of two rational numbers: one
denotes the logical time, one denotes the grace timing. The above
example is shown here with timing tuples

@lilypond[quote,raggedright]
<<
  \relative c''{ 
    c4 \grace c16  c4  \grace {
    c16[  d16] } c2 c4
  }
  \new Lyrics \lyrics {
    \markup { (0,0) } 4
    \grace { \markup {
      ( \fraction 1 4 ,  \fraction -1 16 ) } 16 }
    \markup { (\fraction 1 4 , 0 ) } 4
    \grace {
      \markup { (\fraction 2 4 , \fraction "-1" 8 ) } 16
      \markup { (\fraction 2 4 , \fraction "-1" 16 ) } 16
    } 
    \markup { ( \fraction 2 4 , 0 ) }
  }
>>
@end lilypond


The placement of grace notes is synchronized between different staves.
In the following example, there are two sixteenth graces notes for
every eighth grace note

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim,fragment] 
<< \new Staff { e4 \grace { c16[ d e f] } e4 }
   \new Staff { c'4 \grace { g8[ b] } c4 } >>
@end lilypond



If you want to end a note with a grace, the standard trick is to put
the grace notes after a ``space note''

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\context Voice {
  << { d1^\trill ( }
     { s2 \grace { c16[ d] } } >>
  c4)
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
By adjusting the duration of the skip note (here it is a half-note),
the space between the main-note and the grace is adjusted.


A @code{\grace} section will introduce special typesetting settings,
for example, to produce smaller type, and set directions. Hence, when
introducing layout tweaks, they should be inside the grace section,
for example,
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\new Voice {
  \acciaccatura {
    \override Stem #'direction = #-1
    f16->
    \revert Stem #'direction
  }
  g4
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
The overrides should also be reverted inside the grace section.

If the layout of grace sections must be changed throughout the music,
then this can be accomplished through the function
@code{add-grace-property}. The following example undefines the Stem
direction for this grace, so stems do not always point up.

@example
\new Staff @{
   #(add-grace-property "Voice" Stem direction '())
   @dots{}
@}
@end example

@noindent
Another option is to change the variables @code{startGraceMusic},
@code{stopGraceMusic}, @code{startAccacciaturaMusic},
@code{stopAccacciaturaMusic}, @code{startAppoggiaturaMusic},
@code{stopAppoggiaturaMusic}.  More information is in the file
@file{ly/grace-init.ly}.


@seealso

Program reference: @internalsref{GraceMusic}.

@refbugs

A score that starts with an @code{\grace} section needs an explicit
@code{\context Voice} declaration, otherwise the main note and grace
note end up on different staves.

Grace note synchronization can also lead to surprises. Staff notation,
such as key signatures, bar lines, etc. are also synchronized. Take
care when you mix staves with grace notes and staves without, for example,

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim,fragment]
<< \new Staff { e4 \bar "|:" \grace c16 d4 }
   \new Staff { c4  \bar "|:"  d4 } >>
@end lilypond

@noindent
This can be remedied by inserting grace skips, for the above example

@example
\new Staff @{ c4  \bar "|:"  \grace s16 d4 @} >>
@end example

Grace sections should only be used within sequential music
expressions.  Nesting or juxtaposing grace sections is not supported,
and might produce crashes or other errors.

@cindex repeats
@cindex @code{\repeat}


Repetition is a central concept in music, and multiple notations exist
for repetitions. In LilyPond, most of these notations can be captured
in a uniform syntax. One of the advantages is that they can be
rendered in MIDI accurately.

The following types of repetition are supported

@table @code
@item unfold
Repeated music is fully written (played) out.  Useful for MIDI
output, and entering repetitive music.

@item volta
This is the normal notation: Repeats are not written out, but
alternative endings (volte) are printed, left to right.

@ignore
@item fold
Alternative endings are written stacked. This has limited use but may be
used to typeset two lines of lyrics in songs with repeats, see
@inputfileref{input,star-spangled-banner.ly}.
@end ignore

@c tremolo, beamed
@item tremolo
Make tremolo beams.

@item percent
Make beat or measure repeats. These look like percent signs.

@node Repeat syntax
@subsection Repeat syntax


LilyPond has one syntactic construct for specifying different types of
repeats.  The syntax is

@example
  \repeat @var{variant} @var{repeatcount} @var{repeatbody}
@end example

If you have alternative endings, you may add
@cindex @code{\alternative}
@example
 \alternative @code{@{} @var{alternative1}
            @var{alternative2}
            @var{alternative3} @dots{} @code{@}}
@end example
where each @var{alternative} is a music expression.  If you do not
give enough alternatives for all of the repeats, the first alternative
is assumed to be played more than once.

Normal notation repeats are used like this
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
c1
\repeat volta 2 { c4 d e f }
\repeat volta 2 { f e d c }
@end lilypond

With alternative endings
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
c1
\repeat volta 2 {c4 d e f} 
\alternative { {d2 d} {f f,} }
@end lilypond


@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\context Staff {
  \partial 4
  \repeat volta 4 { e | c2 d2 | e2 f2 | }
  \alternative { { g4 g g } { a | a a a a | b2. } }
}
@end lilypond

@refbugs

A nested repeat like

@example 
\repeat @dots{}
\repeat @dots{}
\alternative 
@end example 

@noindent
is ambiguous, since it is is not clear to which @code{\repeat} the
@code{\alternative} belongs. This ambiguity is resolved by always
having the @code{\alternative} belong to the inner @code{\repeat}.
For clarity, it is advisable to use braces in such situations.

Timing information is not remembered at the start of an alternative,
so after a repeat timing information must be reset by hand, for
example by setting @code{Score.measurePosition} or entering
@code{\partial}.  Similarly, slurs or ties are also not repeated.

Patterns of a one and two measures are replaced by percent-like signs,
patterns that divide the measure length are replaced by slashes

Sometimes you might want to show only the rhythm of a melody.  This

@subsection Percussion staves
@cindex percussion
@cindex drums

A percussion part for more than one instrument typically uses a
multiline staff where each position in the staff refers to one piece
of percussion.


To typeset the music, the notes must be interpreted in a
@internalsref{DrumStaff} and @internalsref{DrumVoice} contexts

@c
@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
up = \drums { crashcymbal4 hihat8 halfopenhihat hh hh hh openhihat }

    \new DrumVoice { \voiceOne \up } 
    \new DrumVoice { \voiceTwo \down } 
  >>
}
@end lilypond

The above example shows verbose polyphonic notation. The short
polyphonic notation, described in @ref{Polyphony}, can also be used if
the @internalsref{DrumVoices} are instantiated by hand first. For example, 

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim] 
\drums \new DrumStaff <<
  \context DrumVoice = "1" {  s1 *2 }
  \context DrumVoice = "2" {  s1 *2 }
  {

    <<
      { \repeat unfold 16 hh16 }
      \\
      { bd4 sn4 bd4 sn4 }
    >>
  }

@node Piano music
@section Piano music

Piano staves are two normal staves coupled with a brace.  The staves
are largely independent, but sometimes voices can cross between the
two staves.  The same notation is also used for harps and other key
instruments.  The @internalsref{PianoStaff} is especially built to
handle this cross-staffing behavior.  In this section we discuss the
@internalsref{PianoStaff} and some other pianistic peculiarities.

@end menu 

@refbugs

There is no support for putting chords across staves.  You can get
this result by increasing the length of the stem in the lower stave so
it reaches the stem in the upper stave, or vice versa. An example is
included with the distribution as
@inputfileref{input/test,stem-cross-staff.ly}.

Dynamics are not centered, but kludges do exist. See
@inputfileref{input/template,piano-dynamics.ly}.

@cindex cross staff stem
@cindex stem, cross staff
@cindex distance between staves in piano music

The distance between the two staves is normally fixed across the
entire score. It is possible to tune this per system, but it does
require arcane command incantations. See
@inputfileref{input/test,piano-staff-distance.ly}.


@node Automatic staff changes
@subsection Automatic staff changes
@cindex Automatic staff changes

Voices can switch automatically between the top and the bottom
staff. The syntax for this is

@quotation
@example
\autochange \context Voice @{ @dots{}@var{music}@dots{} @}
@end example
@end quotation

@noindent
The two staves of the piano staff must be named @code{up} and
@code{down}.

A @code{\relative} section that is outside of @code{\autochange} has
no effect on the pitches of @var{music}, so, if necessary, put
@code{\relative} inside @code{\autochange} like

@quotation
@example
\autochange \relative @dots{} \new Voice @dots{}
@end example
@end quotation


The autochanger switches on basis of pitch (middle C is the turning
point), and it looks ahead skipping over rests to switch in
advance. Here is a practical example
        
@lilypond[quote,verbatim,raggedright]
\score { \notes \context PianoStaff <<
  \context Staff = "up" {
    \autochange \new Voice \relative c' {
       g4 a  b c d r4 a g } }
  \context Staff = "down" {
       \clef bass
       s1*2
} >> }
@end lilypond

@noindent
In this example, spacer rests are used to prevent the bottom staff from
terminating too soon.


@seealso

In this manual: @ref{Manual staff switches}.

Program reference: @internalsref{AutoChangeMusic}.



@refbugs

The staff switches often do not end up in optimal places. For high
quality output, staff switches should be specified manually.


@code{\autochange} cannot be inside @code{\times}. 

Internally, the @code{\partcombine} interprets both arguments as
@code{Voice}s named @code{one} and @code{two}, and then decides when
the parts can be combined. Consequently, if the arguments switch to
differently named @internalsref{Voice} contexts, the events in those
will be ignored.


@node Manual staff switches
@subsection Manual staff switches

@cindex manual staff switches
@cindex staff switch, manual

Voices can be switched between staves manually, using the following command
@example
\change Staff = @var{staffname} @var{music}
@end example

@noindent
The string @var{staffname} is the name of the staff. It switches the
current voice from its current staff to the Staff called
@var{staffname}. Typically @var{staffname} is @code{"up"} or
@code{"down"}. The @context{Staff} referred to must already exist, so
usually the setup for a score will start with a setup of the staves,

@example
  <<
  \context Staff = up @{
    \skip 1 * 10  %@emph{ keep staff alive}
    @}
  \context Staff = down @{
    \skip 1 * 10  %@emph{idem}
    @}
  >>
@end example 


and the @context{Voice} is inserted afterwards

@example
  \context Staff = down
    \new Voice @{ @dots{} \change Staff = up @dots{} @}
@end example


@node Pedals
@subsection Pedals
@cindex Pedals

Pianos have pedals that alter the way sound are produced. Generally, a
piano has three pedals, sustain, una corda, and sostenuto.


Piano pedal instruction can be expressed by attaching
@code{\sustainDown}, @code{\sustainUp}, @code{\unaCorda},
@code{\treCorde}, @code{\sostenutoDown} and @code{\sostenutoUp} to a
note or chord

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
c'4\sustainDown c'4\sustainUp
@end lilypond

What is printed can be modified by setting @code{pedal@var{X}Strings},
where @var{X} is one of the pedal types: @code{Sustain},
@code{Sostenuto} or @code{UnaCorda}.  Refer to
@internalsref{SustainPedal} in the program reference for more
information.

Pedals can also be indicated by a sequence of brackets, by setting the 
@code{pedalSustainStyle} property to @code{bracket} objects

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\set Staff.pedalSustainStyle = #'bracket
c\sustainDown d e
b\sustainUp\sustainDown
b g \sustainUp a \sustainDown \bar "|."
@end lilypond

A third style of pedal notation is a mixture of text and brackets,
obtained by setting the @code{pedalSustainStyle} style property to
@code{mixed}

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\set Staff.pedalSustainStyle = #'mixed
c\sustainDown d e
b\sustainUp\sustainDown
b g \sustainUp a \sustainDown \bar "|."
@end lilypond

The default `*Ped.' style for sustain and damper pedals corresponds to
style @code{#'text}. The sostenuto pedal uses @code{mixed} style by
default.

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
c\sostenutoDown d e c, f g a\sostenutoUp
@end lilypond

For fine-tuning of the appearance of a pedal bracket, the properties
@code{edge-width}, @code{edge-height}, and @code{shorten-pair} of
@code{PianoPedalBracket} objects (see
@internalsref{PianoPedalBracket} in the Program reference)  can be modified.  For example, the
bracket may be extended to the end of the note head

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\override Staff.PianoPedalBracket  
   #'shorten-pair = #'(0 . -1.0)

@end lilypond

@node Arpeggio
@subsection Arpeggio
@cindex Arpeggio

@cindex broken arpeggio
@cindex @code{\arpeggio}

You can specify an arpeggio sign on a chord by attaching an
@code{\arpeggio} to a chord


@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=1,verbatim]
<c e g c>\arpeggio
@end lilypond

When an arpeggio crosses staves, you attach an arpeggio to the chords
in both staves, and set
@internalsref{PianoStaff}.@code{connectArpeggios}

@lilypond[quote,fragment,relative=1,verbatim]
\context PianoStaff <<
  \set PianoStaff.connectArpeggios = ##t
  \new Staff  { <c' e g c>\arpeggio }

\context Voice {

@subsection Entering lyrics


@cindex lyrics
@cindex @code{\lyrics}
@cindex punctuation

Lyrics are entered in a special input mode. This mode is is introduced
by the keyword @code{\lyrics}.  In this mode you can enter lyrics, with
punctuation and accents without any hassle.  Syllables are entered like
notes, but with pitches replaced by text.  For example,
@example
  \lyrics @{ Twin-4 kle4 twin- kle litt- le star2 @}
@end example

A word in Lyrics mode begins with: an alphabetic character, @code{_},
@code{?}, @code{!}, @code{:}, @code{'}, the control characters @code{^A}
through @code{^F}, @code{^Q} through @code{^W}, @code{^Y}, @code{^^},
any 8-bit character with ASCII code over 127, or a two-character
combination of a backslash followed by one of @code{`}, @code{'},
@code{"}, or @code{^}.

Subsequent characters of a word can be any character that is not a digit
and not white space.  One important consequence of this is that a word
can end with @code{@}}. The following example is usually a bug. The
syllable includes a @code{@}}, and hence the opening brace is not balanced
@example
  \lyrics @{ twinkle@}
@end example

@cindex @code{\property}, in @code{\lyrics}
Similarly, a period following a alphabetic sequence, is included in
the resulting string. As a consequence, spaces must be inserted around
property commands
@example
  \override Score . LyricText #'font-shape = #'italic
@end example

@cindex @code{_}
@cindex spaces, in lyrics
@cindex quotes, in lyrics

Any @code{_} character which appears in an unquoted word is converted
to a space.  This provides a mechanism for introducing spaces into words
without using quotes.  Quoted words can also be used in Lyrics mode to
specify words that cannot be written with the above rules

@example
  \lyrics @{ He said: "\"Let" my peo ple "go\"" @}
@end example
However, at least for english texts, you should use 
@example
  \lyrics @{ He said: ``Let my peo ple go'' @}
@end example
to get the correct shape of the starting and ending quote.

@cindex hyphens

Centered hyphens are entered as `@code{-}@code{-}' between syllables.
The hyphen will have variable length depending on the space between
the syllables and it will be centered between the syllables.

@cindex melisma
@cindex extender

When a lyric is sung over many notes (this is called a melisma), this is
indicated with a horizontal line centered between a syllable and the
next one. Such a line is called an extender line, and it is entered as
@code{__}.

Examples: @inputfileref{input/test,lyric-hyphen-retain.ly}.

@refbugs

The definition of lyrics mode is too complex.



@node The Lyrics context
@subsection  The Lyrics context

Lyrics are printed by interpreting them in a @internalsref{Lyrics} context
@example
 \context Lyrics \lyrics @dots{}
@end example

@cindex automatic syllable durations
@cindex @code{\lyricsto}
@cindex lyrics and melodies

This will place the lyrics according to the durations that were
entered. The lyrics can also be aligned under a given melody
automatically.  In this case, it is no longer necessary to enter the
correct duration for each syllable.  This is achieved by combining the
melody and the lyrics with the @code{\lyricsto} expression
@example
\lyricsto @var{name} \new Lyrics @dots{} 
@end example

This aligns the lyrics to the
@c
notes of the @internalsref{Voice} context called @var{name}, which has
to exist. Therefore, normally the @code{Voice} is specified first, and
then the lyrics are specified with @code{\lyricsto}.

For different or more complex orderings, the best way is to setup the
hierarchy of staves and lyrics first, e.g.
@example
\context ChoirStaff \notes <<
  \context Lyrics = sopranoLyrics @{ s1 @}
  \context Voice = soprano @{ @emph{music} @}
  \context Lyrics = tenorLyrics @{ s1 @}
  \context Voice = tenor @{ @emph{music} @}
>>
@end example
and then combine the appropriate melodies and lyric lines
@example
  \lyricsto "soprano" \context Lyrics = sopranoLyrics
     @emph{the lyrics}
@end example

@noindent
The final input would resemble

@example
  << \context ChoirStaff \notes << @emph{setup the music}  >>
     \lyricsto "soprano" @emph{etc}
     \lyricsto "alto" @emph{etc}
     @emph{etc}
  >>
@end example 


The @code{\lyricsto} command detects melismata: it only puts one
syllable under a tied or slurred group of notes. If you want to force
an unslurred group of notes to be a melisma, insert @code{\melisma}
after the first note of the group, and @code{\melismaEnd} after the
last one, e.g.

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,raggedright,fragment,verbatim]
<<
  \context Voice = "lala" {
    \time 3/4
    f4 g8
    \melisma 
    f e f
    \melismaEnd
    e2
  }
  \lyricsto "lala" \new Lyrics \lyrics {
    la di __ daah 
  }
>>
@end lilypond

In addition, notes are considered a melisma if they are manually
beamed, and automatic beaming (see @ref{Setting automatic beam
behavior}) is switched off.  The criteria for deciding melismata can
be tuned with the property @code{melismaBusyProperties}. See
@internalsref{Melisma_translator} in the program reference for more
information.

When multiple stanzas are put on the same melody, it can happen that
two stanzas have melismata in different locations. This can be

Melismata are not detected automatically, and extender lines must be
inserted by hand.


For proper processing of extender lines, the
@internalsref{Lyrics} and @internalsref{Voice} should be

setting corresponding names for both contexts. The latter is explained
in @ref{More stanzas}.

@cindex phrasing, in lyrics


The lyrics should be aligned with the note heads of the melody. To
achieve this, each line of lyrics should be marked to correspond with
the melodic line. This is done automatically when @code{\lyricsto},
but it can also be done manually. 

To this end, give the @internalsref{Voice} context an identity
@example
\context Voice = duet @{
     \time 3/4
     g2 e4 a2 f4 g2.  @}
@end example

Then set the @internalsref{Lyrics} contexts to names starting with
that identity followed by a dash.  In the preceding example, the
@internalsref{Voice} identity is @code{duet}, so the identities of the
@internalsref{Lyrics}s are marked @code{duet-1} and @code{duet-2}
@example
  \context Lyrics = "duet-1" @{
    Hi, my name is Bert. @}
  \context Lyrics = "duet-2" @{
    Ooooo, ch\'e -- ri, je t'aime. @}

@node Ambitus
@subsection Ambitus
@cindex ambitus

The term @emph{ambitus} denotes a range of pitches for a given voice
in a part of music.  It also may denote the pitch range that a musical
instrument is capable of playing.  Ambituses are printed on vocal
parts, so singers can easily determine if it meets his or her
capabilities.

It denoted at the beginning of a piece near the initial clef.  The
range is graphically specified by two note heads, that represent the
minimum and maximum pitch.  To print such ambituses, add the
@internalsref{Ambitus_engraver} to the @internalsref{Voice} context,
for example,

@example
  \paper @{
    \context @{
      \VoiceContext
      \consists Ambitus_engraver
    @}
  @}
@end example

This results in the following output

@node Tablatures
@section Tablatures

Tablature notation is used for notating music for plucked string
instruments.  It notates pitches not by using note heads, but by
indicating on which string and fret a note must be played.  LilyPond
offers limited support for tablature.

@node Tablatures basic
@subsection Tablatures basic
@cindex Tablatures basic

The string number associated to a note is given as a backslash
followed by a number, e.g. @code{c4\3} for a C quarter on the third
string. By default, string 1 is the highest one, and the tuning
defaults to the standard guitar tuning (with 6 strings).  The notes
are printed as tablature, by using @internalsref{TabStaff} and
@internalsref{TabVoice} contexts

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\notes \context TabStaff {
  a,4\5 c'\2 a\3 e'\1
  e\4 c'\2 a\3 e'\1

@end lilypond

@cindex minimumFret

When no string is specified, the first string that does not give a
fret number less than @code{minimumFret} is selected. The default
value for @code{minimumFret} is 0


@example

@cindex Non-guitar tablatures

You can change the number of strings, by setting the number of lines
in the @internalsref{TabStaff}. 

You can change the tuning of the strings. A string tuning is given as
a Scheme list with one integer number for each string, the number
being the pitch (measured in semitones relative to middle C) of an
open string.  The numbers specified for @code{stringTuning} are the
numbers of semitones to subtract or add, starting the specified pitch
by default middle C, in string order. Thus, the notes are e, a, d, and
g

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
  \context TabStaff <<

@section Chord names
@cindex Chords

LilyPond has support for both printing chord names.  Chords may be
entered in musical chord notation, i.e. @code{< .. >}, but they can
also be entered by name. Internally, the chords are represented as a
set of pitches, so they can be transposed

This example also shows that the chord printing routines do not try to
be intelligent. The last chord (@code{f bes d}) is not interpreted as
an inversion.

Chord mode is a mode where you can input sets of pitches using common
names.  It is introduced by the keyword @code{\chords}.
In chords mode,  a  chord is entered by the root, which is entered
like a common pitch
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]

Other chords may be entered by suffixing a colon, and introducing a
modifier, and optionally, a number
@c
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\chords { e1:m e1:7 e1:m7  }
@end lilypond
The first number following the root is taken to be the `type' of the
chord, thirds are added to the root until it reaches the specified
number

@end lilypond

@cindex root of chord
@cindex additions, in chords
@cindex removals, in  chords

More complex chords may also be constructed  adding separate steps
to a chord. Additions are added after the  number following
the colon, and are separated by dots
@c
@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\chords { c:5.6 c:3.7.8 c:3.6.13 }
@end lilypond
Chord steps can be  altered by suffixing a @code{-} or @code{+} sign
to the number
@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\chords { c:7+ c:5+.3-  c:3-.5-.7- }
@end lilypond
Removals are specified similarly, and are introduced by a caret.  They
must come after the additions
@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\chords { c^3 c:7^5 c:9^3.5 }
@end lilypond

Modifiers can be used to change pitches. The following modifiers are
supported
@table @code
@item m
  is the minor chord. This modifier lowers the 3rd and (if present) the 7th step.
@item dim
  is the   diminished chord. This modifier lowers the 3rd, 5th and (if present)
  the 7th step.
@item aug
  is the augmented chord. This modifier raises the 5th step.
@item maj
  is the major 7th chord. This modifier raises the 7th step if present.  
@item sus
  is the suspended 4th or 2nd. This modifier removes the 3rd
step. Append either @code{2} or @code{4} to add the 2nd or 4th step to
the chord.

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\chords { c:13 c:13.11 c:m13 }
@end lilypond

@cindex @code{/}

An inversion (putting one pitch of the chord on the bottom), as well
as bass notes, can be specified by appending
@code{/}@var{pitch} to the chord
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\chords { c1 c/g c/f }
@end lilypond
@cindex @code{/+}

A bass note can be added instead of transposed out of the chord,
by using  @code{/+}@var{pitch}.

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\chords { c1 c/+g c/+f }
@end lilypond

Chords is a mode similar to @code{\lyrics}, @code{\notes} etc.  Most
of the commands continue to work, for example, @code{r} and
@code{\skip} can be used to insert rests and spaces, and property
commands may be used to change various settings.

The default chord name layout is a system for Jazz music, proposed by
Klaus Ignatzek (see @ref{Literature list}).  It can be tuned through the
following properties

@table @code
@cindex chordNameExceptions
@item chordNameExceptions
This is a list that contains the chords that have special formatting.
For an example, see
@inputfileref{input/regression,chord-name-exceptions.ly}.
@cindex exceptions, chord names.


@cindex majorSevenSymbol
@item majorSevenSymbol
This property contains the markup object used for the 7th step, when
it is major. Predefined options are @code{whiteTriangleMarkup} and
@code{blackTriangleMarkup}.  See
@inputfileref{input/regression,chord-name-major7.ly} for an example.

@cindex chordNameSeparator
@item chordNameSeparator
Different parts of a chord name are normally separated by a
slash. By setting @code{chordNameSeparator}, you can specify other
separators, e.g.
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\context ChordNames \chords {
  c:7sus4
  \set chordNameSeparator
    = \markup { \typewriter "|" }
  c:7sus4
}
@end lilypond

@cindex chordRootNamer
@item chordRootNamer
The root of a chord is usually printed as a letter with an optional
alteration. The transformation from pitch to letter is done by this
function.  Special note names (for example, the German ``H'' for a
B-chord) can be produced by storing a new function in this property.

The predefined variables @code{\germanChords},
@code{\semiGermanChords} set these variables.


@cindex chordNoteNamer
@item chordNoteNamer
The default is to print single pitch, e.g. the bass note, using the
@code{chordRootNamer}.  The @code{chordNoteNamer} property can be set
to a specialized function to change this behavior.  For example, the
base can be printed in lower case.

@end table


There are also two other chord name schemes implemented: an alternate
Jazz chord notation, and a systematic scheme called Banter chords. The

  c1 \mark #8 
  c1 \mark \default

@noindent
(The letter I is skipped in accordance with engraving traditions.)

The mark is incremented automatically if you use @code{\mark

manually.  The value to use is stored in the property
@code{rehearsalMark}.

The style is defined by the property @code{markFormatter}. It is a
function taking the current mark (an integer) and the current context
as argument. It should return a markup object. In the following
example, @code{markFormatter} is set to a canned procedure. After a

@node Instrument names
@subsection Instrument names

In an orchestral score, instrument names are printed left side of the
staves.

This can be achieved by setting @internalsref{Staff}.@code{instrument}

@node Transpose
@subsection Transpose
@cindex Transpose
@cindex transposition of pitches
@cindex @code{\transpose}

A music expression can be transposed with @code{\transpose}.  The
syntax is
@example
\transpose @var{from} @var{to} @var{musicexpr}
@end example

This means that @var{musicexpr} is transposed by the interval between
the pitches @var{from} and @var{to}: any note with pitch @code{from}
is changed to @code{to}.


For example, consider  a piece written in the key of  D major.  If
this piece is a  little too low for its performer, it can be
transposed up to E major with
@example
\transpose d e @dots{}
@end example

Consider a part  written for violin (a C instrument). If
this part is to be played on the A clarinet, the following
transposition will produce the appropriate part

@example
\transpose a c @dots{}
@end example   

Since @var{from} and @var{to} are pitches, so @code{\transpose} must be
inside a @code{\notes} section.  @code{\transpose} distinguishes
between enharmonic pitches: both @code{\transpose c cis} or
@code{\transpose c des} will transpose up half a tone.  The first
version will print sharps and the second version will print flats

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
mus =\notes { \key d \major cis d fis g }

@refbugs

If you want to use both @code{\transpose} and @code{\relative},

The transposition is entered after the keyword @code{\transposition}

@example
  \transposition bes   %%  B-flat clarinet

multimeasure rest. This expansion is controlled by the property
@code{Score.skipBars}. If this is set to true, empty measures will not
be expanded, and the appropriate number is added automatically

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
 \time 4/4 r1 | R1 | R1*2
 \set Score.skipBars = ##t R1*17  R1*4
@end lilypond

The @code{1} in @code{R1} is similar to the duration notation used for
notes. Hence, for time signatures other than 4/4, you must enter other
durations.  This can be done with augmentation dots or fractions

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
\set Score.skipBars = ##t
\time 3/4
R2. | R2.*2
\time 13/8
R1*13/8
R1*13/8*12
@end lilypond

An @code{R} spanning a single measure is printed as either a whole rest
or a breve, centered in the measure regardless of the time signature.

@cindex text on multi-measure rest
@cindex script on multi-measure rest
@cindex fermata on multi-measure rest

Texts can be added to multi-measure rests by using the
@var{note}-@code{markup} syntax (see @ref{Text markup}).  In this case, the number is
replaced. If you need both texts and the number, you must add the
number by hand. A variable (@code{\fermataMarkup}) is provided for
adding fermatas


@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
  \time 3/4
  R2._\markup { "Ad lib" }
  R2.^\fermataMarkup
@end lilypond

If you want to have a text on the left end of a multi-measure rest,
attach the text to a zero-length skip note, i.e.

@example
  s1*0^"Allegro"
  R1*4 
@end example


@cindex whole rests for a full measure 

@seealso

Program reference: @internalsref{MultiMeasureRestEvent},
@internalsref{MultiMeasureTextEvent},
@internalsref{MultiMeasureRestMusicGroup}, and
@internalsref{MultiMeasureRest}.

The layout object @internalsref{MultiMeasureRestNumber} is for the
default number, and @internalsref{MultiMeasureRestText} for user
specified texts.

@refbugs

It is not possible to use fingerings (e.g. @code{R1-4}) to put numbers
over multi-measure rests.

@cindex condensing rests

There is no way to automatically condense multiple rests into a single
multimeasure rest. Multi measure rests do not take part in rest
collisions.

Be careful when entering multimeasure rests followed by whole
notes. The following will enter two notes lasting four measures each
@example
 R1*4 cis cis 
@end example
When @code{skipBars} is set, the result will look OK, but the bar
numbering will be off.

@node Automatic part combining
@subsection Automatic part combining
@cindex automatic part combining
@cindex part combiner


Automatic part combining is used to merge two parts of music onto a
staff.  It is aimed at typesetting orchestral scores.  When the two
parts are identical for a period of time, only one is shown.  In
places where the two parts differ, they are typeset as separate
voices, and stem directions are set automatically.  Also, solo and
@emph{a due} parts are identified and can be marked.

The syntax for part combining is

@example
  \partcombine @var{musicexpr1} @var{musicexpr2}
@end example

The music expressions will be interpreted as @internalsref{Voice}
contexts. If using relative octaves, @code{\relative} should be
specified for both music expressions, i.e.

@example
\partcombine \relative @dots{}  @var{musicexpr1}
  \relative @dots{} @var{musicexpr2}
@end example

@noindent
A @code{\relative} section that is outside of @code{\partcombine} has
no effect on the pitches of @var{musicexpr1} and @var{musicexpr2}.


The following example demonstrates the basic functionality of the part
combiner: putting parts on one staff, and setting stem directions and
polyphony

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,raggedright,fragment]
\new Staff \partcombine
  \relative g' { g g a( b) c c r r }
  \relative g' { g g r4 r e e g g }
@end lilypond

The first @code{g} appears only once, although it was
specified twice (once in each part).  Stem, slur and tie directions are
set automatically, depending whether there is a solo or unisono. The
first part (with context called @code{one}) always gets up stems, and
`solo', while the second (called @code{two}) always gets down stems and
`Solo II'.

If you just want the merging parts, and not the textual markings, you
may set the property @code{soloADue} to false

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,raggedright,fragment,relative=2]
\new Staff <<
  \set Staff.soloADue = ##f
  \partcombine
    \relative g' { g a( b) r }
    \relative g' { g r4 r f }
>>
@end lilypond

@seealso

Program reference: @internalsref{PartCombineMusic},
@internalsref{SoloOneEvent}, and
@internalsref{SoloTwoEvent}, and
@internalsref{UnisonoEvent}.

@refbugs

In @code{soloADue} mode, when the two voices play the same notes on and
off, the part combiner may typeset @code{a2} more than once in a
measure.

@code{\partcombine} cannot be inside @code{\times}. 

@code{\partcombine} cannot be inside @code{\relative}. 

Internally, the @code{\partcombine} interprets both arguments as
@code{Voice}s named @code{one} and @code{two}, and then decides when
the parts can be combined. Consequently, if the arguments switch to
differently named @internalsref{Voice} contexts, the events in those
will be ignored.

@node Hiding staves
@subsection Hiding staves

@cindex Frenched scores
@cindex Hiding staves

In orchestral scores, staff lines that only have rests are usually
removed.  This saves some space. This style is called `French Score'.
For @internalsref{Lyrics}, 
@internalsref{ChordNames} and @internalsref{FiguredBass}, this is
switched on by default.  When these line of these contexts turn out
empty after the line-breaking process, they are removed.

For normal staves, a specialized @internalsref{Staff} context is
available, which does the same: staves containing nothing (or only
multi measure rests) are removed. The context definition is stored in
@code{\RemoveEmptyStaffContext} variable. Observe how the second staff
in this example disappears in the second line


@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\score  {
  \notes \relative c' <<
    \new Staff { e4 f g a \break c1 }
    \new Staff { c4 d e f \break R1 }
  >>
  \paper {
    linewidth = 6.\cm 
    \context { \RemoveEmptyStaffContext }
  }
}
@end lilypond

The first page shows all staves in full. If empty staves should be
removed from the first page too, set @code{remove-first} to false in
@internalsref{RemoveEmptyVerticalGroup}.

Another application is making ossia sections, i.e. alternative
melodies on a separate piece of staff, with help of a Frenched
staff. See @inputfileref{input/test,ossia.ly} for an example.


@node Different editions from one source
@subsection Different editions from one source

The @code{\tag} command marks music expressions with a name. These
tagged expressions can be filtered out later.  With this mechanism it
is possible to make different versions of the same music source.

In the following example, we see two versions of a piece of music, one
for the full score, and one with cue notes for the instrumental part

@example
  c1
  \relative c' <<
    \tag #'part <<
      R1 \\
      @{
        \set fontSize = #-1
        c4_"cue" f2 g4 @} 
    >>
    \tag #'score R1
  >>
  c1
@end example

The same can be applied to articulations, texts, etc.: they are
made by prepending
@example
        -\tag #@var{your-tag} 
@end example
to an articulation, for example, 
@example
    c1-\tag #'part ^4
@end example

This defines a note with a conditional fingering indication.

By applying the @code{remove-tag} function, tagged expressions can be
filtered. For example,
@example
\simultaneous @{
  @var{the music}
  \apply #(remove-tag 'score) @var{the music}
  \apply #(remove-tag 'part) @var{the music}
@}
@end example
would yield

@lilypondfile[quote]{tag-filter.ly}

The argument of the @code{\tag} command should be a symbol, or a list
of symbols, for example,
@example
  \tag #'(original-part transposed-part) @dots{}
@end example

@seealso

Examples: @inputfileref{input/regression,tag-filter.ly}.


@node Quoting other voices
@subsection Quoting other voices

With quotations, fragments of other parts can be inserted into a part
directly. Before a part can be quoted, it must be marked especially as
quotable. This is done with code @code{\addquote} command. The
quotation may then be done with @code{\quote}

@example
\addquote @var{name} @var{music}
\quote @var{name} @var{duration}  
@end example

@noindent

Here, @var{name} is an identifying string. The @var{music} is any kind
of music.  This is an example of @code{\addquote}

@verbatim
\addquote clarinet \notes\relative c' {
  f4 fis g gis
}
@end verbatim

During a part, a piece of music can be quoted with the @code{\quote}
command. 
  
@example
\quote clarinet 2.
@end example

This would cite 3 quarter notes (a dotted half note) of the previously
added clarinet voice.

Quotations take into account the transposition both source and target
instruments, if they are specified using the @code{\transposition} command.

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
\addquote clarinet \notes\relative c' {
  \transposition bes
  f4 fis g gis
}
\score {
  \notes {
  e'8 f'8 \quote clarinet 2
} }
@end lilypond

@refbugs

Only the contents of the first @internalsref{Voice} occurring in an
@code{\addquote} command will be considered for quotation, so
@var{music} can not contain @code{\new} and @code{\context Voice}
statements that would switch to a different Voice.

Support for ancient notation includes features for mensural notation
and Gregorian Chant notation.  There is also limited support for
figured bass notation.

Many graphical objects provide a @code{style} property, see
@ref{Ancient note heads}, @ref{Ancient accidentals}, @ref{Ancient
rests}, @ref{Ancient clefs}, @ref{Ancient flags} and @ref{Ancient time
signatures}.  By manipulating such a grob property, the typographical
appearance of the affected graphical objects can be accommodated for a
specific notation flavor without need for introducing any new
notational concept.

Other aspects of ancient notation can not that easily be expressed as
in terms of just changing a style property of a graphical object.
Therefore, some notational concepts are introduced specifically for
ancient notation, see @ref{Custodes}, @ref{Divisiones},
@ref{Ligatures}, and @ref{Figured bass}.

@end menu

If this all is way too much of documentation for you, and you just
want to dive into typesetting without worrying too much about the
details on how to customize a context, you may have a look at the
predefined contexts (see @ref{Vaticana style contexts}).  Use them to
set up predefined style-specific voice and staff contexts, and
directly go ahead with the note entry.

@refbugs

Ligatures need special spacing that has not yet been implemented.  As
a result, there is too much space between ligatures most of the time,
and line breaking often is unsatisfactory.  Also, lyrics do not
correctly align with ligatures.

Accidentals must not be printed within a ligature, but instead need to
be collected and printed in front of it.

Augmentum dots within ligatures are  not handled correctly.


@node Ancient note heads
@subsection Ancient note heads

@cindex note heads


For ancient notation, a note head style other than the @code{default}
style may be chosen.  This is accomplished by setting the @code{style}
property of the NoteHead object to the desired value (@code{baroque},
@code{neo_mensural} or @code{mensural}).  The @code{baroque} style
differs from the @code{default} style only in using a square shape for
@code{\breve} note heads.  The @code{neo_mensural} style differs from
the @code{baroque} style in that it uses rhomboidal heads for whole
notes and all smaller durations.  Stems are centered on the note
heads.  This style is in particular useful when transcribing mensural
music, e.g. for the incipit.  The @code{mensural} style finally
produces note heads that mimic the look of note heads in historic
printings of the 16th century.

The following example demonstrates the @code{neo_mensural} style

@lilypond[quote,fragment,raggedright,verbatim]
\override NoteHead #'style = #'neo_mensural
a'\longa a'\breve a'1 a'2 a'4 a'8 a'16
@end lilypond

When typesetting a piece in Gregorian Chant notation, a Gregorian
ligature engraver will automatically select the proper note heads,
such there is no need to explicitly set the note head style.  Still,
the note head style can be set e.g. to @code{vaticana_punctum} to
produce punctum neumes.  Similarly, a mensural ligature engraver is
used to automatically assemble mensural ligatures.  See
@ref{Ligatures} for how ligature engravers work.

@seealso

In this manual
@ref{Percussion staves} use note head styles of their own that are
frequently used in contemporary music notation.

Examples: @inputfileref{input/regression,note-head-style.ly} gives an
overview over all available note head styles.


@node Ancient accidentals

Use the @code{style} property of grob @internalsref{Accidental} to

@code{mensural}, @code{vaticana}, @code{hufnagel} and @code{medicaea}.

As shown, not all accidentals are supported by each style.  When
trying to access an unsupported accidental, LilyPond will switch to a
different style, as demonstrated in
@inputfileref{input/test,ancient-accidentals.ly}.

Similarly to local accidentals, the style of the key signature can be
controlled by the @code{style} property of the
@internalsref{KeySignature} grob.

@cindex rests


Use the @code{style} property of grob @internalsref{Rest} to select
ancient accidentals.   Supported styles are @code{classical},
@code{neo_mensural} and @code{mensural}.  @code{classical} differs
from the @code{default} style only in that the quarter rest looks like
a horizontally mirrored 8th rest.  The @code{neo_mensural} style suits
well for e.g. the incipit of a transcribed mensural piece of music.
The @code{mensural} style finally mimics the appearance of rests as
in historic prints of the 16th century.

The following example demonstrates the @code{neo_mensural} style

@lilypond[quote,fragment,raggedright,verbatim]
\override Rest #'style = #'neo_mensural

@end lilypond

There are no 32th and 64th rests specifically for the mensural or
neo-mensural style.  Instead, the rests from the default style will be
taken.  See @inputfileref{input/test,rests.ly} for a chart of all

There are no rests in Gregorian Chant notation; instead, it uses
@ref{Divisiones}.

differ only with respect to the line they are printed on.  In such
cases, a trailing number in the name is used to enumerate these clefs.
Still, you can manually force a clef glyph to be typeset on an

There is no particular flag style for neo-mensural notation.  Hence,
when typesetting e.g. the incipit of a transcribed piece of mensural
music, the default flag style should be used.  There are no flags in
Gregorian Chant notation.

@cindex time signatures


There is limited support for mensural time signatures.   The
glyphs are hard-wired to particular time fractions.  In other words,
to get a particular mensural signature glyph with the @code{\time n/m}
command, @code{n} and @code{m} have to be chosen according to the
following table

Use the @code{style} property of grob @internalsref{TimeSignature} to
select ancient time signatures.  Supported styles are
@code{neo_mensural} and @code{mensural}.  The above table uses the
@code{neo_mensural} style.  This style is appropriate e.g. for the
incipit of transcriptions of mensural pieces.  The @code{mensural}
style mimics the look of historical printings of the 16th century.

@inputfileref{input/test,time.ly} gives an overview over all available
ancient and modern styles.

@seealso

Program reference: @ref{Time signature} gives a general introduction into the use of time
signatures.

@refbugs

Mensural signature glyphs are mapped to time fractions in a hard-wired
way.  This mapping is sensible, but still arbitrary: given a mensural
time signature, the time fraction represents a modern meter that
usually will be a good choice when transcribing a mensural piece of
music.  For a particular piece of mensural music, however, the mapping
may be unsatisfactory.  In particular, the mapping assumes a fixed
transcription of durations (e.g. brevis = half note in 2/2, i.e. 4:1).
Some glyphs (such as the alternate glyph for 6/8 meter) are not at all
accessible through the @code{\time} command.

Mensural time signatures are supported typographically, but not yet
musically.  The internal representation of durations is 
based on a purely binary system; a ternary division such as 1 brevis =
3 semibrevis (tempus perfectum) or 1 semibrevis = 3 minima (cum
prolatione maiori) is not correctly handled: event times in ternary
modes will be badly computed, resulting e.g. in horizontally
misaligned note heads, and bar checks are likely to erroneously fail.

The syntax and semantics of the @code{\time} command for mensural
music is subject to change.

@node Custodes
@subsection Custodes

@cindex custos
@cindex custodes

A @emph{custos} (plural: @emph{custodes}; Latin word for `guard') is a
symbol that appears at the end of a staff.  It anticipates the pitch
of the first note(s) of the following line and thus helps the player
or singer to manage line breaks during performance, thus enhancing
readability of a score.

Custodes were frequently used in music notation until the 17th
century.  Nowadays, they have survived only in a few particular forms
of musical notation such as contemporary editions of Gregorian chant
like the @emph{editio vaticana}.  There are different custos glyphs
used in different flavors of notational style.

For typesetting custodes, just put a @internalsref{Custos_engraver} into the
@internalsref{Staff} context when declaring the @code{\paper} block,
as shown in the following example

@example
\paper @{
  \context @{
     \StaffContext
     \consists Custos_engraver
     Custos \override #'style = #'mensural
  @}
@}
@end example

The result looks like this

@lilypond[quote,raggedright]
\score {
    \notes {
	a'1
	\override Staff.Custos #'style = #'mensural
	\break
	g'
    }
    \paper {
	\context {
	    \StaffContext
	    \consists Custos_engraver
	}
    }
}
@end lilypond

The custos glyph is selected by the @code{style} property. The styles
supported are @code{vaticana}, @code{medicaea}, @code{hufnagel} and
@code{mensural}.  They are demonstrated in the following fragment

@lilypond[quote]

       \new Lyrics    \lyrics {

@node Divisiones
@subsection Divisiones

@cindex divisio
@cindex divisiones
@cindex finalis

A @emph{divisio} (plural: @emph{divisiones}; Latin word for
`division') is a staff context symbol that is used to structure
Gregorian music into phrases and sections.  The musical meaning of
@emph{divisio minima}, @emph{divisio maior} and @emph{divisio maxima}
can be characterized as short, medium and long pause, somewhat like
@ref{Breath marks}.  The @emph{finalis} sign not only marks the end of
a chant, but is also frequently used within a single
antiphonal/responsorial chant to mark the end of each section.


To use divisiones, include the file @code{gregorian-init.ly}.  It
contains definitions that you can apply by just inserting
@code{\divisioMinima}, @code{\divisioMaior}, @code{\divisioMaxima},
and @code{\finalis} at proper places in the input.  Some editions use
@emph{virgula} or @emph{caesura} instead of divisio minima.
Therefore, @code{gregorian-init.ly} also defines @code{\virgula} and
@code{\caesura}

@node Ligatures
@subsection Ligatures

@cindex Ligatures

@c TODO: Should double check if I recalled things correctly when I wrote
@c down the following paragraph by heart.

A ligature is a coherent graphical symbol that represents at least two
distinct notes.  Ligatures originally appeared in the manuscripts of
Gregorian chant notation roughly since the 9th century to denote
ascending or descending sequences of notes.  

Ligatures are entered by enclosing them in @code{\[} and @code{\]}.
Some ligature styles may need additional input syntax specific for
this particular type of ligature.  By default, the
@internalsref{LigatureBracket} engraver just puts a square bracket
above the ligature

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim]
\score {
  \notes \transpose c c' {
    \[ g c a f d' \]
    a g f
    \[ e f a g \]
  }
}
@end lilypond

To select a specific style of ligatures, a proper ligature engraver
has to be added to the @internalsref{Voice} context, as explained in
the following subsections.   Only white mensural ligatures
are supported with certain limitations.

@menu
* White mensural ligatures::    
* Gregorian square neumes ligatures::  
@end menu

@node White mensural ligatures
@subsubsection White mensural ligatures

@cindex Mensural ligatures
@cindex White mensural ligatures

There is limited support for white mensural ligatures.  

To engrave white mensural ligatures, in the paper block the
@internalsref{Mensural_ligature_engraver} has to be put into the
@internalsref{Voice} context, and remove the
@internalsref{Ligature_bracket_engraver}

@example
    \paper @{
        \context @{
            \VoiceContext
            \remove Ligature_bracket_engraver
            \consists Mensural_ligature_engraver
        @}
    @}
@end example

There is no additional input language to describe the shape of a
white mensural ligature.  The shape is rather determined solely from
the pitch and duration of the enclosed notes.  While this approach may
take a new user a while to get accustomed, it has the great advantage
that the full musical information of the ligature is known internally.
This is not only required for correct MIDI output, but also allows for
automatic transcription of the ligatures.

For example,

@example
        \set Score.timing = ##f
        \set Score.defaultBarType = "empty"
        \override NoteHead #'style = #'neo_mensural
        \override Staff.TimeSignature   #'style = #'neo_mensural
        \clef "petrucci_g"
        \[ g\longa c\breve a\breve f\breve d'\longa \]
        s4
        \[ e1 f1 a\breve g\longa \]
@end example
@lilypond[quote,raggedright]
\score {
    \notes \transpose c c' {
        \set Score.timing = ##f
        \set Score.defaultBarType = "empty"
        \override NoteHead #'style = #'neo_mensural
        \override Staff.TimeSignature   #'style = #'neo_mensural
        \clef "petrucci_g"
        \[ g\longa c\breve a\breve f\breve d'\longa \]
        s4
        \[ e1 f1 a\breve g\longa \]
    }
    \paper {
        \context {
            \VoiceContext
            \remove Ligature_bracket_engraver
            \consists Mensural_ligature_engraver
        }
    }
}
@end lilypond

Without replacing @internalsref{Ligature_bracket_engraver} with
@internalsref{Mensural_ligature_engraver}, the same music transcribes
to the following

@lilypond[quote,raggedright]
\score {
    \notes \transpose c c' {
        \set Score.timing = ##f
        \set Score.defaultBarType = "empty"
        \override NoteHead #'style = #'neo_mensural
        \override Staff.TimeSignature   #'style = #'neo_mensural
        \clef "petrucci_g"
        \[ g\longa c\breve a\breve f\breve d'\longa \]
        s4
        \[ e1 f1 a\breve g\longa \]
    }
}
@end lilypond

@refbugs

The implementation is experimental; it may output strange warnings or
even crash in some cases or produce weird results on more complex
ligatures.

Gregorian square neumes notation (following the style of the Editio
Vaticana) is under heavy development, but not yet really usable for
production purposes.  Core ligatures can already be typeset, but
essential issues for serious typesetting are still under development,
such as (among others) horizontal alignment of multiple ligatures,
lyrics alignment and proper accidentals handling.  Still, this section
gives a sneak preview of what Gregorian chant may look like once it
will work.

The following table contains the extended neumes table of the 2nd

Unlike most other neumes notation systems, the input language for
neumes does not necessarily reflect directly the typographical
appearance, but is designed to solely focuse on musical meaning.  For
example, @code{\[ a \pes b \flexa g \]} produces a Torculus consisting
of three Punctum heads, while @code{\[ a \flexa g \pes b \]} produces
a Porrectus with a curved flexa shape and only a single Punctum head.
There is no command to explicitly typeset the curved flexa shape; the
decision of when to typeset a curved flexa shape is purely taken from
the musical input.  The idea of this approach is to separate the
musical aspects of the input from the notation style of the output.
This way, the same input can be reused to typeset the same music in a
different style of Gregorian chant notation.

The following table shows the code fragments that produce the
ligatures in the above neumes table.  The letter in the first column
in each line of the below table indicates to which ligature in the
above table it refers.  The second column gives the name of the
ligature.  The third column shows the code fragment that produces this
ligature, using @code{g}, @code{a} and @code{b} as example pitches.

The predefined @code{VaticanaVoiceContext} and

Gregorian Chant in the style of the Editio Vaticana.  These contexts
initialize all relevant context properties and grob properties to

@node Figured bass
@subsection Figured bass

@cindex Basso continuo

@c TODO: musicological blurb about FB


LilyPond has limited support for figured bass

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
<<
  \context Voice \notes { \clef bass dis4  c d ais }
  \context FiguredBass \figures {
    < 6 >4 < 7 >8 < 6+ [_!] >
    < 6 >4 <6 5 [3+] >
  }
>>
@end lilypond

The support for figured bass consists of two parts: there is an input
mode, introduced by @code{\figures}, where you can enter bass figures
as numbers, and there is a context called @internalsref{FiguredBass} that
takes care of making @internalsref{BassFigure} objects.

In figures input mode, a group of bass figures is delimited by
@code{<} and @code{>}. The duration is entered after the @code{>>}
@example
<4 6>
@end example
@lilypond[quote,fragment]
\context FiguredBass
\figures { <4 6> }
@end lilypond

Accidentals are added when you append @code{-}, @code{!}  and @code{+}
to the numbers

@example
<4- 6+ 7!>
@end example
@lilypond[quote,fragment]
\context FiguredBass
\figures { <4- 6+ 7!> }
@end lilypond

Spaces or dashes may be inserted by using @code{_}. Brackets are
introduced with @code{[} and @code{]}

@example
< [4 6] 8 [_! 12]>
@end example
@lilypond[quote,fragment]
\context FiguredBass
\figures { < [4 6] 8 [_! 12]> }
@end lilypond

Although the support for figured bass may superficially resemble chord
support, it works much simpler.  The @code{\figures} mode simply
stores the numbers , and @internalsref{FiguredBass} context prints
them as entered. There is no conversion to pitches, and no
realizations of the bass are played in the MIDI file.

Internally, the code produces markup texts. You can use any of the
markup text properties to override formatting. For example, the
vertical spacing of the figures may be set with @code{baseline-skip}.

@node Contemporary notation
@section Contemporary notation

In the 20th century, composers have greatly expanded the musical
vocabulary. With this expansion, many innovations in musical notation
have been tried. The book by Stone (1980) gives a comprehensive
overview (see @ref{Literature list}). In general, the use of new,
innovative notation makes a piece harder to understand and perform and
its use should therefore be avoided if possible.  For this reason,
support for contemporary notation in LilyPond is limited.

@node Clusters
@subsection Clusters

@cindex cluster

A cluster indicates a continuous range of pitches to be played.  They
can be denoted as the envelope of a set of notes.  They are entered by
applying the function @code{notes-to-clusters} to a sequence of
chords, e.g.
@c
@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
\apply #notes-to-clusters {  <c e > <b f'>  }
@end lilypond

The following example (from
@inputfileref{input/regression,cluster.ly}) shows what the result
looks like

@lilypondfile[quote]{cluster.ly}

Ordinary notes and clusters can be put together in the same staff,
even simultaneously.  In such a case no attempt is made to
automatically avoid collisions between ordinary notes and clusters.

@seealso

Program reference: @internalsref{ClusterSpanner},
@internalsref{ClusterSpannerBeacon},

Music expressions like @code{<< @{ g8 e8 @} a4 >>} are not printed
accurately.  Use @code{<g a>8 <e a>8} instead.



@node Fermatas
@subsection Fermatas

Contemporary music notation frequently uses special fermata symbols to
indicate fermatas of differing lengths.  The following fermatas are
supported

@lilypond[quote,raggedright]

@node Balloon help
@subsection Balloon help

Elements of notation can be marked and named with the help of a square
balloon.  The primary purpose of this feature is to explain notation.

The following example demonstrates its use.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,raggedright,relative=2]
\context Voice
\applyoutput
   #(add-balloon-text 'NoteHead "heads, or tails?"
    '(1 . -3))
c8
@end lilypond

@noindent
The function @code{add-balloon-text} takes the name of a grob, the
label to print and where to put the label relative to the object. In
the above example, the text ``heads or tails?'' ends 3 spaces below
the `balloon.'

The `easy play' note head includes a  name inside the head.  It is
used in music for beginners

@lilypond[quote,raggedright,verbatim,staffsize=26]
\setEasyHeads

@end lilypond

The command @code{\setEasyHeads} overrides settings for the
@internalsref{NoteHead} object.  To make the letters readable, it has
to be printed in a large font size.  To print with a larger font, see
@ref{Setting global staff size}.

@node Sound
@section Sound
@cindex Sound

Entered music can also be converted to MIDI output.  The performance
is intended for proof-hearing the music for errors.

Ties, dynamics and tempo changes are interpreted.  Dynamic marks,
crescendi and decrescendi translate into MIDI volume levels.  Dynamic
marks translate to a fixed fraction of the available MIDI volume
range, crescendi and decrescendi make the volume vary linearly between
their two extremities.  The fractions can be adjusted by
@code{dynamicAbsoluteVolumeFunction} in @internalsref{Voice} context.
For each type of MIDI instrument, a volume range can be defined.  This
gives a basic equalizer control, which can enhance the quality of
the MIDI output remarkably.  The equalizer can be controlled by
setting @code{instrumentEqualizer}.

@refbugs

Many musically interesting effects, such as swing, articulation,
slurring, etc., are not translated to MIDI.

The MIDI output allocates a channel for each Staff, and one for global
settings.  Hence, the MIDI file should not have more than 15 staves
(or 14 if you do not use drums). Other staves will remain silent.

A number followed by a period is interpreted as a real number, so
for setting the tempo for dotted notes, an extra space should be
inserted, for example

@example
  \midi @{ \tempo 4 . = 120 @} 
@end example
