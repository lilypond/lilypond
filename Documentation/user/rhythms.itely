Durations are designated by numbers and dots.  Durations are entered
as their reciprocal values.  For example, a quarter note is entered
using a @code{4} (since it is a 1/4 note), and a half note is entered
using a @code{2} (since it is a 1/2 note).  For notes longer than a
whole you must use the @code{\longa} (a double breve) and
@code{\breve} commands.  Durations as short as 128th notes may be
specified.  Shorter values are possible, but only as beamed notes.

A note with the duration of a quadruple breve may be entered with
@code{\maxima}, but this is supported only within ancient music
notation.  For details, see @ref{Ancient notation}.

If the duration is omitted, it is set to the previously
entered duration.  The default for the first note is a quarter
note.

Some durations cannot be represented with just binary durations
and dots; they can be represented only by tying two or more
notes together.  For details, see @ref{Ties}.

For ways of specifying durations for the syllables of lyrics and
ways of aligning lyrics to notes, see @ref{Vocal music}.

Optionally, notes can be spaced strictly proportionately to their
duration.  For details of this and other settings which control
proportional notation, see @ref{Proportional notation}.

rests from 128th to maxima (8 x whole) may be printed.


@node Tuplets
@unnumberedsubsubsec Tuplets

@cindex tuplets
@cindex triplets

@funindex \times
@funindex times

Tuplets are made from a music expression by multiplying all the
durations with a fraction:

@example
\times @var{fraction} @{ @var{music} @}
@end example

@noindent
The duration of @var{music} will be multiplied by the
fraction.  The fraction's denominator will be printed over or
under the notes, optionally with a bracket.  The most common
tuplet is the triplet in which 3 notes have the duration of 2, so
the notes are 2/3 of their written length.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]

@end lilypond

@funindex \tupletUp
@funindex tupletUp

The automatic placement of the tuplet bracket above or below the
notes may be overridden manually with predefined commands, for
details see @ref{Direction and placement}.

Tuplets may be nested:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
\autoBeamOff
c4 \times 4/5 { f8 e f \times 2/3 { e[ f g] } } f4 |
@end lilypond

Modifying nested tuplets which begin at the same musical moment
must be done with @code{\tweak}.

To modify the duration of notes without printing a tuplet bracket,
see @ref{Scaling durations}.

@cindex grace notes within tuplet brackets
When the first note on a staff is a grace note followed by a
tuplet the grace note must be placed before the @code{\times}
command to avoid errors.  Anywhere else, grace notes may be
placed within tuplet brackets.


@node Scaling durations
@unnumberedsubsubsec Scaling durations

@cindex scaling durations
@cindex durations, scaling

You can alter the duration of single notes, rests or chords by a
fraction @code{N/M} by appending @code{*N/M} (or @code{*N} if @code{M}
is 1) to the duration.  This will not affect the appearance of the
notes or rests produced, but the altered duration will be used in
calculating the position within the measure and setting the duration
in the MIDI output.  Multiplying factors may be combined such as
@code{*L*M/N}.

In the following example, the first three notes take up exactly
two beats, but no triplet bracket is printed.

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
\time 2/4
% Alter durations to triplets
a4*2/3 gis4*2/3 a4*2/3
% Normal durations
a4 a4
% Double the duration of chord
<a d>4*2
% Duration of quarter, appears like sixteenth
b16*4 c4
@end lilypond

The duration of skip or spacing notes may also be modified by
a multiplier.  This is useful for skipping many measures, e.g.,
@code{s1*23}.

@cindex compressing music

@funindex \scaleDurations
@funindex scaleDurations

Longer stretches of music may be compressed by a fraction in the
same way, as if every note, chord or rest had the fraction as a
multiplier.  This leaves the appearance of the music unchanged but
the internal duration of the notes will be multiplied by the
fraction @emph{num}/@emph{den}.  The spaces around the dot are
required.  Here is an example showing how music can be compressed
and expanded:

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
\time 2/4
% Normal durations
<c a>4 c8 a
% Scale music by *2/3
\scaleDurations #'(2 . 3) {
  <c a f>4. c8 a f
}
% Scale music by *2
\scaleDurations #'(2 . 1) {
  <c' a>4 c8 b
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
One application of this command is in polymetric
notation, see @ref{Polymetric notation}.

@node Ties
@unnumberedsubsubsec Ties

@cindex tie

@funindex ~

A tie connects two adjacent note heads of the same pitch.  The tie
in effect extends the duration of a note.

@warning{Ties should not be confused with @emph{slurs}, which
indicate articulation, or @emph{phrasing slurs}, which indicate
musical phrasing.  A tie is just a way of extending a note
duration, similar to the augmentation dot.}

A tie is entered using the tilde symbol @code{~}

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
a2 ~ a
@end lilypond


@noindent
Ties are used either when the note crosses a bar line, or when
dots cannot be used to denote the rhythm.  Ties should also be
used when note values cross larger subdivisions of the measure:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative c' {
  r8 c8 ~ c2 r4 |
  r8^"not" c2 ~ c8 r4
}
@end lilypond

If you need to tie many notes across bar lines, it may be
easier to use automatic note splitting, see @ref{Automatic note
splitting}.  This mechanism automatically splits long notes, and
ties them across bar lines.

@cindex ties and chords
@cindex chords and ties

When a tie is applied to a chord, all note heads whose pitches
match are connected.  When no note heads match, no ties will be
created.  Chords may be partially tied by placing the tie inside
the chord.

\repeat volta 2 { c g <c e>2 ~ }
\alternative {
  % First alternative: following note is tied normally

Switching staves when a tie is active will not produce a slanted

@cindex rest, multi-measure
@cindex rest, whole-measure

Whole measure rests, centered in the middle of the measure, must be
entered as multi-measure rests.  They can be used for a single
measure as well as many measures and are discussed in @ref{Full
measure rests}.

@cindex rest, specifying vertical position

To explicitly specify a rest's vertical position, write a note
followed by @code{\rest}.  A rest of the duration of the note will
be placed at the staff position where the note would appear.  This
allows for precise manual formatting of polyphonic music, since the
automatic rest collision formatter will not move these rests.

The property @code{measurePosition} contains a rational number
indicating how much of the measure has passed at this point.  Note
that this is set to a negative number by the @code{\partial}

unmetered music (some cadenzas, for example), this is not desirable.
To turn off automatic calculation of bar lines and bar numbers,
use the command @code{\cadenzaOn}, and use @code{\cadenzaOff}
to turn them on again.

LilyPond will insert line breaks and page breaks only at a
bar line.  Unless the unmetered music ends before the end of the
staff line, you will need to insert invisible bar lines with

to indicate where breaks can occur.

Polymetric notation is supported, either explicitly or by modifying
the visible time signature symbol and scaling the note durations.

@strong{@i{Staves with different time signatures, equal measure lengths}}

This notation can be created by setting a common time signature
for each staff but replacing the symbol manually by setting
@code{timeSignatureFraction} to the desired fraction and scaling
the printed durations in each staff to the common time
signature; see @ref{Time signature}.  The scaling is done with
@code{\scaleDurations}, which is used in a similar way to
@code{\times}, but does not create a tuplet bracket; see
@ref{Scaling durations}.

@cindex beaming in polymetric music
@cindex beaming in polymetric meter

In this example, music with the time signatures of 3/4, 9/8, and
10/8 are used in parallel.  In the second staff, shown durations
are multiplied by 2/3, as 2/3 * 9/8 = 3/4, and in the third
staff, shown durations are multiplied by 3/5, as 3/5 * 10/8 = 3/4.
It will often be necessary to insert beams manually, as the
duration scaling affects the autobeaming rules.

When using different time signatures in parallel, notes
at the same moment will be be placed at the same horizontal
location.  However, the bar lines in the different staves
will cause the note spacing to be less regular in each of the
individual staves than would be normal without the different

There are two types of beaming rules:  @emph{beam-grouping}
rules and @emph{beam-ending} rules.  Beam-grouping rules are the
simplest, but are over-ridden by any beam-ending rules which apply.

The placement of automatic beams is determined by applying the
following rules in order:

@itemize

@item If a manual beam is specified with @code{[..]} set the beam
as specified, otherwise

@item if @code{\autoBeamOff} is in force do not beam, otherwise

@item if a beam-ending rule applies use it to determine the valid
places where beams may end, otherwise

@item if a valid (see below) beat-grouping rule applies use it to
group notes with beams, otherwise

@item use the value of @code{beatLength} to group notes with beams

@end itemize

@i{@strong{Modifying the grouping of beats}}

If there are no beam-ending rules defined for the beam duration of a
particular beam in the time signature in use, its beaming is
controlled by three context properties:
@code{measureLength}, @code{beatLength} and @code{beatGrouping}.
These properties may be set in the @code{Score}, @code{Staff} or
@code{Voice} contexts to delimit their scope.  The default values
are set while processing @code{\time} commands, so any @code{\set}
commands to modify their value must be placed after all @code{\time}
commands.

@warning{These three properties become effective for a particular
beam @strong{only} if there are no beam-ending rules predefined for
that beam's duration in the time signature in use, or if these
beam-ending rules have all been reverted.}

These determine the beaming as follows:

Beams may begin anywhere (unless a beam is already active).  Beams
end at a time determined by the values of @code{beatGrouping} and
@code{beatLength}, as follows:

@itemize

@item If @code{beatGrouping} and @code{beatLength} are consistent
with @code{measureLength}, @code{beatGrouping} is used to determine
the end points of beams.

@item If @code{beatGrouping} and @code{beatLength} are inconsistent
with @code{measureLength}, @code{beatLength} is used to determine
the end points of beams.

@end itemize

By default the @code{measureLength} and @code{beatLength} are
derived from the time signature set by the @code{\time} command.
The @code{measureLength} is set to be exactly the same length as
the measure length given by the time signature, and the
@code{beatLength} is set to be the same as one over the denominator
of the time signature.

The default value of @code{beatGrouping} is taken from a table in
@file{scm/@/music@/-functions@/.scm}.  To find this, see
@rlearning{Other sources of information}.  It defines the beat
grouping for 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 8/8, and all the common compound time
signatures.

Both @code{measureLength} and @code{beatLength} are @i{moments},
units of musical duration.  A quantity of type @i{moment} is
created by the scheme function @code{ly:make-moment}.  For more
information about this function, see @ref{Time administration}.

@code{beatGrouping} is a list of integers giving the number of
beats in each group.

@strong{@i{Modifying the beam end points}}

Beam-ending rules are required when beams of different durations are
to end at different points within the measure.  For example, it may
be desirable for eighth-note beams in 4/4 time to end only at the
end of the measure or half-way through it, but for sixteenth-note
beams to end at quarter note positions to avoid overly long beamed
runs.  The rules work as follows:

Automatic beams can start on any note but can end at only a few
positions within the measure, namely at positions specified by the
properties in @code{autoBeamSettings}.  These properties consist of
a list of rules defining where beams can end.  The default
@code{autoBeamSettings} rules are defined in
@file{scm/@/auto@/-beam@/.scm}.  To find this file, see
@rlearning{Other sources of information}.

In order to add a rule to the list, use

@example
#(override-auto-beam-setting
  '(beam-limit
    beam-numerator  beam-denominator
    time-signature-numerator time-signature-denominator)
  moment-numerator moment-denominator [context])
@end example

@noindent
where

@itemize

@item @code{beam-limit} is the type of automatic beam limit
defined.  This can be either @code{begin} or @code{end} but
only @code{end} is effective.

@item @code{beam-numerator/beam-denominator} is the beam duration
to which the rule is to apply.  A beam is considered to have
the duration of its shortest note.  Set @code{beam-numerator}
and @code{beam-denominator} to @code{'*'} to have this rule apply
to beams of any duration.

@item @code{time-signature-numerator/time-signature-denominator}
specifies the time signature to which this rule should apply.
If @code{time-signature-numerator} and
@code{time-signature-denominator} are set to @code{'*'} this rule
will apply in any time signature.

@item @code{monent-numerator/moment-denominator} is the position
in the bar at which the beam should end.

@item @code{context} is optional, and it specifies the context at which
the change should be made.  The default is @code{'Voice}.

@code{#(score-override-auto-beam-setting '(A B C D) E F)} is equivalent to
@code{#(override-auto-beam-setting '(A B C D) E F 'Score)}.

@end itemize

For example, if automatic beams should always end on the first quarter
note, whatever the time signature or beam duration, use

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
a8 a a a a a a a
#(override-auto-beam-setting '(end * * * *) 1 4)

In some cases it may be necessary to override the automatic
beaming algorithm.  For example, the autobeamer will not put beams
over rests or bar lines, and in choral scores the beaming is
often set to follow the meter of the lyrics rather than the
notes. Such beams can be specified manually by
marking the begin and end point with @code{[} and @code{]}

Even more strict manual control with the beams can be achieved by
setting the properties @code{stemLeftBeamCount} and
@code{stemRightBeamCount}.  They specify the number of beams to
draw on the left and right side, respectively, of the next note.
If either property is set, its value will be used only once, and
then it is erased.  In this example, the last @code{f} is printed
with only one beam on the left side, i.e., the eighth-note beam of
the group as a whole.

@funindex \featherDurations
@funindex featherDurations
@funindex grow-direction

Feathered beams are used to indicate that a small group of notes
should be played at an increasing (or decreasing) tempo, without
changing the overall tempo of the piece.  The extent of the
feathered beam must be indicated manually using @code{[} and
@code{]}, and the beam feathering is turned on by specifying a
direction to the @code{Beam} property @code{grow-direction}.

If the placement of the notes and the sound in the MIDI output
is to reflect the ritardando or accelerando indicated by the
feathered beam the notes must be grouped as a
music expression delimited by braces and preceded by a
@code{featheredDurations} command which specifies the ratio
between the durations of the first and last notes in the group.

The square brackets show the extent of the beam and the braces show
which notes are to have their durations modified.  Normally these
would delimit the same group of notes, but this is not required: the
two commands are independent.

In the following example the eight 16th notes occupy exactly the
same time as a half note, but the first note is one half as long
as the last one, with the intermediate notes gradually
lengthening.  The first four 32nd notes gradually speed up, while
the last four 32nd notes are at a constant tempo.

@lilypond[relative=1,verbatim,quote]

% revert to non-feathered beams
\override Beam #'grow-direction = #'()

@end lilypond

@noindent
The spacing in the printed output represents the
note durations only approximately, but the MIDI output is exact.

into the printed output at places based on the current time
signature.

The simple bar lines inserted automatically can be changed to
other types with the @code{\bar} command.  For example, a closing
double bar line is usually placed at the end of a piece:

@lilypond[quote,relative=1,verbatim]
e4 d c2 \bar "|."
@end lilypond

It is not invalid if the final note in a measure does not
end on the automatically entered bar line: the note is assumed
to carry over into the next measure.  But if a long sequence
of such carry-over measures appears the music can appear compressed
or even flowing off the page.  This is because automatic line
breaks happen only at the end of complete measures, i.e., where
all notes end before the end of a measure.

@warning{An incorrect duration can cause line breaks to be
inhibited, leading to a line of highly compressed music or
music which flows off the page.}

@cindex line breaks
@cindex bar lines, invisible
@cindex measure lines, invisible

Line breaks are also permitted at manually inserted bar lines
even within incomplete measures.  To allow a line break without
printing a bar line, use

@example
\bar ""
@end example

@noindent
This will insert an invisible bar line and allow (but not
force) a line break to occur at this point.  The bar number
counter is not increased.  To force a line break see
@ref{Line breaking}.

@cindex manual bar lines
@cindex manual measure lines
@cindex bar lines, manual
@cindex measure lines, manual

This and other special bar lines may be inserted manually at any
point.  When they coincide with the end of a measure they replace the
simple bar line which would have been inserted there automatically.
When they do not coincide with the end of a measure the specified bar
line is inserted at that point in the printed output.  Such insertions
do not affect the calculation and placement of subsequent automatic
bar lines.

Two types of simple bar lines and five types of double bar lines are available
for manual insertion:

@lilypond[quote,relative=1,verbatim]
f1 \bar "|" f \bar "." g \bar "||" a \bar ".|" b \bar ".|." c \bar "|.|" d \bar "|." e
@end lilypond

@noindent
together with dotted and dashed bar lines:

@lilypond[quote,relative=1,verbatim]
f1 \bar ":" g \bar "dashed" a
@end lilypond

@noindent
and five types of repeat bar line:

@lilypond[quote,relative=1,verbatim]
f1 \bar "|:" g \bar ":|:" a \bar ":|.|:" b \bar ":|.:" c \bar ":|" d
@end lilypond

Additionally, a bar line can be printed as a simple tick:
@lilypond[quote,relative=1,verbatim]
f1 \bar "'"
@end lilypond
However, as such ticks are typically used in Gregorian chant, it is preferable 
to use @code{\divisioMinima} there instead, described in the section 
@ref{Divisiones} in Gregorian chant.


@cindex repeats

Although the bar line types signifying repeats may be inserted
manually they do not in themselves cause LilyPond to recognize
a repeated section.  Such repeated sections are better entered
using the various repeat commands (see @ref{Repeats}), which
automatically print the appropriate bar lines.

In addition, you can specify @code{"||:"}, which is equivalent to
@code{"|:"} except at line breaks, where it gives a double bar
line at the end of the line and a start repeat at the beginning of
the next line.

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
\override Score.RehearsalMark #'padding = #3
c c c c
\bar "||:"
c c c c \break
\bar "||:"
c c c c
@end lilypond

In scores with many staves, a @code{\bar} command in one staff is
automatically applied to all staves.  The resulting bar lines are
connected between different staves of a @code{StaffGroup},
@code{PianoStaff}, or @code{GrandStaff}.

@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
<<
  \new StaffGroup <<
    \new Staff {
      e'4 d'

@funindex currentBarNumber

Bar numbers are typeset by default at the start of every line except
the first line.  The number itself is stored in the
@code{currentBarNumber} property, which is normally updated
automatically for every measure.  It may also be set manually:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,fragment,relative=1]

@c @lilypondfile[verbatim,lilyquote,ragged-right,texidoc,doctitle]
@c {printing-the-bar-number-for-the-first-measure.ly}

Bar numbers can be typeset at regular intervals instead of just at
the beginning of every line.  To do this the default behavior
must be overridden to permit bar numbers to be printed at places
other than the start of a line.  This is controlled by the
@code{break-visibility} property of @code{BarNumber}.  This takes
three values which may be set to @code{#t} or @code{#f} to specify
whether the corresponding bar number is visible or not.  The order
of the three values is @code{end of line visible}, @code{middle of
line visible}, @code{beginning of line visible}.  In the following
example bar numbers are printed at all possible places:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]
\override Score.BarNumber #'break-visibility = #'#(#t #t #t)
\set Score.currentBarNumber = #11
\bar ""  % Permit first bar number to be printed

@end lilypond

@c  All the rest of these examples will be added to LSR
@c  and moved into the Snippets.  -gp

@noindent
and here the bar numbers are printed every two measures
except at the end of the line:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]
\override Score.BarNumber #'break-visibility = #'#(#f #t #t)
\set Score.currentBarNumber = #11

c1 c c c c
\break
c c c c c
@end lilypond

@cindex measure number, format
@cindex bar number, format

The size of the bar number may be changed.  This is illustrated
in the following example, which also shows how to enclose bar
numbers in boxes and circles, and shows an alternative way
of specifying @code{#(#f #t #t)} for @code{break-visibility}.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]

\repeat unfold 4 { c1 } \bar "|."
@end lilypond

@cindex bar number alignment

Bar numbers by default are left-aligned to their parent object.
This is usually the left edge of a line or, if numbers are printed
within a line, the left bar line of the measure.  The numbers may also
be positioned directly on the bar line or right-aligned to the
bar line:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]
\set Score.currentBarNumber = #111
\override Score.BarNumber #'break-visibility = #'#(#t #t #t)
% Increase the size of the bar number by 2
\override Score.BarNumber #'font-size = #2
% Print a bar number every second measure
\set Score.barNumberVisibility = #(every-nth-bar-number-visible 2)

% Center-align bar numbers
\override Score.BarNumber #'self-alignment-X = #0
c1 c1
% Right-align bar numbers
\override Score.BarNumber #'self-alignment-X = #-1

@end lilypond

Bar numbers can be removed entirely by removing the
@code{Bar_number_engraver} from the @code{Score} context.

@funindex barCheckSynchronize
@funindex |

Bar checks help detect errors in the entered durations.  A bar check
may be entered using the bar symbol, @code{|}, at any place where a
bar line is expected to fall.  If bar check lines are encountered at
other places, a list of warnings is printed in the log file, showing
the line numbers and lines in which the bar checks failed.  In the
next example, the second bar check will signal an error.

@example
\time 3/4 c2 e4 | g2 |
@end example

Bar checks can also be used in lyrics, for example

@example
\lyricmode @{
  \time 2/4
  Twin -- kle | Twin -- kle |
@}
@end example

An incorrect duration can result in a completely garbled score,
especially if the score is polyphonic, so a good place to start
correcting input is by scanning for failed bar checks and
incorrect durations.

If successive bar checks are off by the same musical interval,
only the first warning message is displayed.  This allows the
warning to focus on the source of the timing error.


@funindex |
@funindex pipeSymbol

It is also possible to redefine the action taken when a bar check
or pipe symbol, @code{|}, is encountered in the input, so that
it does something other than a bar check.  This is done by
assigning a music expression to @code{pipeSymbol}.
In the following example @code{|} is set to insert a double bar
line wherever it appears in the input, rather than checking
for end of bar.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
pipeSymbol = \bar "||"

  c'2 c'2 |

@funindex \barNumberCheck
@funindex barNumberCheck

When copying large pieces of music, it can be helpful to check
that the LilyPond bar number corresponds to the original that you
are entering from.  This can be checked with
@code{\barNumberCheck}, for example,

@verbatim
\barNumberCheck #123
@end verbatim

will print a warning if the @code{currentBarNumber} is not 123

Grace notes are ornaments that are written out. Grace notes
are printed in a smaller font and take up no logical time
in a measure.

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
c4 \grace c16 c4
\grace { c16[ d16] } c2
@end lilypond

Lilypond also supports two special types of grace notes, the
@emph{acciaccatura}--an unmeasured grace note indicated by a slurred
small note with a slashed stem--and the @emph{appoggiatura}, which
takes a fixed fraction of the main note and appears in small print
without a slash.

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
\grace c8 b4
\acciaccatura d8 c4
\appoggiatura e8 d4
\acciaccatura { g16[ f] } e4
@end lilypond

The placement of grace notes is synchronized between different
staves.  In the following example, there are two sixteenth grace
notes for every eighth grace note

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
<< \new Staff { e2 \grace { c16[ d e f] } e2 }
   \new Staff { c2 \grace { g8[ b] } c2 } >>
@end lilypond

@cindex grace notes, following

@funindex \afterGrace
@funindex afterGrace

If you want to end a note with a grace, use the @code{\afterGrace}
command.  It takes two arguments: the main note, and the grace
notes following the main note.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
c1 \afterGrace d1 { c16[ d] } c1
@end lilypond

This will put the grace notes after a space lasting 3/4 of the
length of the main note.  The default fraction 3/4 can be changed by
setting @code{afterGraceFraction}.  The following example shows
the results from setting the space at the default,  at 15/16, and
finally at 1/2 of the main note.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
<<
  \new Staff {
    c1 \afterGrace d1 { c16[ d] } c1
  }
  \new Staff {
    #(define afterGraceFraction (cons 15 16))
    c1 \afterGrace d1 { c16[ d] } c1
  }
  \new Staff {
    #(define afterGraceFraction (cons 1 2))
    c1 \afterGrace d1 { c16[ d] } c1
  }
>>
@end lilypond

The space between the main note and the grace note may also be
specified using spacers. The following example places the grace
note after a space lasting 7/8 of the main note.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
\new Voice {
  << { d1^\trill_( }
     { s2 s4. \grace { c16[ d] } } >>
  c1)
}
@end lilypond

A @code{\grace} music expression will introduce special
typesetting settings, for example, to produce smaller type, and
set directions.  Hence, when introducing layout tweaks to
override the special settings, they should be placed inside
the grace expression. The overrides should also be reverted
inside the grace expression. Here, the grace note's default stem
direction is overriden and then reverted.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
\new Voice {
  \acciaccatura {
    \stemDown
    f16->
    \stemNeutral
  }
  g4 e c2
}
@end lilypond


@cindex stem, with slash


@snippets

The slash through the stem found in @emph{acciaccatura}s can be applied
in other situations:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
\relative c'' {
  \override Stem #'stroke-style = #"grace"
  c8( d2) e8( f4)
}
@end lilypond

The layout of grace expressions can be changed throughout the
music using the function @code{add-grace-property}.  The following
example undefines the @code{Stem} direction for this grace, so
that stems do not always point up.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
\relative c'' {
  \new Staff {
    #(add-grace-property 'Voice 'Stem 'direction ly:stem::calc-direction)
    #(remove-grace-property 'Voice 'Stem 'direction)
    \new Voice {
       \acciaccatura { f16 } g4
       \grace { d16[ e] } f4
       \appoggiatura { a,32[ b c d] } e2
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond

Another option is to change the variables @code{startGraceMusic},
@code{stopGraceMusic}, @code{startAcciaccaturaMusic},
@code{stopAcciaccaturaMusic}, @code{startAppoggiaturaMusic},
@code{stopAppoggiaturaMusic}.  The default values of these can be
seen in the file @code{ly/@/grace@/-init@/.ly}.  By redefining
them other effects may be obtained.

Grace notes may be forced to align with regular notes
in other staves:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative c'' {
  <<
    \override Score.SpacingSpanner #'strict-grace-spacing = ##t
    \new Staff {
      c4

Grace note synchronization can also lead to surprises.  Staff
notation, such as key signatures, bar lines, etc., are also
synchronized.  Take care when you mix staves with grace notes and
staves without, for example,

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
<< \new Staff { e4 \bar "|:" \grace c16 d2. }
   \new Staff { c4 \bar "|:" d2. } >>
@end lilypond

@noindent
This can be remedied by inserting grace skips of the corresponding
durations in the other staves.  For the above example

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,verbatim]
<< \new Staff { e4 \bar "|:" \grace c16 d2. }
   \new Staff { c4 \bar "|:" \grace s16 d2. } >>
@end lilypond

Grace sections should only be used within sequential music
expressions.  Nesting or juxtaposing grace sections is not
supported, and might produce crashes or other errors.

@node Aligning to cadenzas
@unnumberedsubsubsec Aligning to cadenzas

@cindex cadenza
@cindex cadenza, aligning to
@cindex aligning to cadenza

In an orchestral context, cadenzas present a special problem: when
constructing a score that includes a measured cadenza or other solo
passage, all other instruments should skip just as many notes as the
length of the cadenza, otherwise they will start too soon or too late.

One solution to this problem is to use the functions
@code{mmrest-of-length} and @code{skip-of-length}.  These Scheme
functions take a defined piece of music as an argument and generate a
multi-measure rest or @code{\skip} exactly as long as the piece.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]

Time is administered by the @code{Timing_translator}, which by
default is to be found in the @code{Score} context.  An alias,
@code{Timing}, is added to the context in which the
@code{Timing_translator} is placed.

The following properties of @code{Timing} are used
to keep track of timing within the score.

@cindex bar number
@cindex measure number

@table @code
@item currentBarNumber
The current measure number.  For an example showing the
use of this property see @ref{Bar numbers}.

@item measureLength
The length of the measures in the current time signature.  For a
4/4 time this is@tie{}1, and for 6/8 it is 3/4.  Its value
determines when bar lines are inserted and how automatic beams
should be generated.

@item measurePosition
The point within the measure where we currently are.  This
quantity is reset by subtracting @code{measureLength} whenever
@code{measureLength} is reached or exceeded.  When that happens,
@code{currentBarNumber} is incremented.

@item timing
If set to true, the above variables are updated for every time
step.  When set to false, the engraver stays in the current
measure indefinitely.

@end table

Timing can be changed by setting any of these variables
explicitly.  In the next example, the default 4/4 time
signature is printed, but @code{measureLength} is set to 5/4.
At 4/8 through the third measure, the @code{measurePosition} is
advanced by 1/8 to 5/8, shortening that bar by 1/8.
The next bar line then falls at 9/8 rather than 5/4.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=1]
\set Score.measureLength = #(ly:make-moment 5 4)
c1 c4
c1 c4
c4 c4
\set Score.measurePosition = #(ly:make-moment 5 8)
b4 b4 b8
c4 c1
@end lilypond

@noindent
As the example illustrates, @code{ly:make-moment n m} constructs a
duration of n/m of a whole note.  For example,
@code{ly:make-moment 1 8} is an eighth note duration and
@code{ly:make-moment 7 16} is the duration of seven sixteenths
notes.
