@subsection Where is guile, libguileX, guile-config?

RedHat users need to install guile-1.4 and guile-devel-1.4, Debian
users need to get guile1.4, libguile9 and libguile9-dev.

If you're building from source, you need guile 1.3.4 or newer.  Verify
that the correct guile, guile-config, and libguile* in your PATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or @file{/etc/ld.so.conf}).

@subsection I upgraded by applying a patch, and now my configure/build breaks.

Patches don't include automatically generated files, i.e. 
@file{configure} and files generated by @file{configure}.  Regenerate them 
yourself:
@example 

    autoconf
    configure
 
@end example 

@subsection Is there an emacs mode?

Yes.  It is included with the source archive as
@file{lilypond-mode.el} and @file{lilypond-font-lock.el}.  If you have
an RPM, it is in @file{/usr/share/doc/lilypond-X/}.  You have to install
it yourself.

Add this to your ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.el:
@example 
    (load-library "lilypond-mode.el")
    (setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '("\\.ly$" . LilyPond-mode) auto-mode-alist))
    (add-hook 'LilyPond-mode-hook (lambda () (turn-on-font-lock)))
@end example

If you have the latest LilyPond-1.3.x Debian package, LilyPond-mode
is automatically loaded, so you need not modify your ~/.emacs file.


@subsection I downloaded the windows32 port, and it doesn't match the website!

The website is usually made from the latest snapshots.  Binary releases,
in particular the windows32 binaries, are only made every once in a while.
They may lag several versions behind the latest version.

@bye
