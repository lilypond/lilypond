@cindex Updating a LilyPond file
@cindex convert-ly

As LilyPond is improved, the syntax (input language) of some
commands and functions can change.  This usually results in
unexpected errors, warnings, or even wrong output when input
files, previously created for older versions of LilyPond, are then
used with later versions.

To help with this, the @command{convert-ly} command can be used to
upgrade older input files to the newer syntax.

@cindex convert-ly
@cindex updating old input files

Syntax changes are often made to make the LilyPond input code
simpler for both reading and writing, but occasionally changes are
made to accommodate new features or enhancements to existing
functions.

Here is a real example to illustrate this.

All @code{\paper} and @code{\layout} property names are supposed
to be written in the form
@code{@var{first}-@/@var{second}-@/@var{third}}.  However, in
LilyPond version 2.11.60, it was noticed that the
@code{printallheaders} property did not follow this convention.
Should this property be left alone (confusing new users with an
inconsistent format)?  Or should it be changed (annoying old users
with existing LilyPond input files)?  The decision was eventually
made to change the name of the property to
@code{print-all-headers}, and by using the @command{convert-ly}
command old users had a way to automatically update their existing
input files.

Unfortunately, the @command{convert-ly} command is not capable to
manage all syntax changes.  For example, accents and non-English
characters were entered using standard @LaTeX{} notation in
versions of LilyPond before 2.6; words like @q{Noël} (which is
@q{Christmas} in French) had to be entered as @code{No\"el}.
Starting with LilyPond 2.6, the special letter @samp{ë} must be
entered directly as a UTF-8 character.  Because
@command{convert-ly} cannot convert @LaTeX{} special characters
into UTF-8 characters, older LilyPond input files have to be
edited manually to take care of that.

The conversion rules of the @command{convert-ly} command work by
using text pattern matching and replacement (rather than
@q{understanding} the context of what it is changing within a
given input file).  This has several consequences:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The reliability of the conversion depends on the quality of each applied
rule set and on the complexity of the respective change.  Sometimes
conversions may require additional, manual fixes, so the original input
files should be kept for comparison just in case.

@item
Only conversions to newer syntax changes are possible: there are
no rule sets to go back to older versions of LilyPond.  As a
consequence, input files should only be upgraded when older
versions of LilyPond are no longer being maintained.  Again, the
original data should be kept just in case, perhaps by using
version control systems like Git to help maintain multiple
versions of your input files.

@item
LilyPond is quite robust when processing @q{creatively} placed or
omitted whitespace, but the rules used by @command{convert-ly}
often make some stylistic assumptions.  For painless upgrades it
is therefore advised to follow the input style as used in the
LilyPond manuals, particularly as the examples in the manuals
themselves are all upgraded using the @command{convert-ly}
command.

@node Command-line preliminaries
@section Command-line preliminaries

This and the following sections only cover the command-line usage
of @command{convert-ly}.  GUI applications like Frescobaldi have
their own interfaces to @command{convert-ly}.

By @q{command line}, we mean the command line in the operating
system.  Windows users might be more familiar with the terms
@q{DOS shell} or @q{command shell}.  macOS users might be more
familiar with the terms @q{terminal} or @q{console}.

Describing how to use this part of an operating system is outside
the scope of this manual; please consult other documentation on
this topic if you are unfamiliar with the command line.

@xref{The PATH environment variable} how to set up the operating
system so that @command{convert-ly} can be used on the command
line without specifying a path.


@subheading Additional setup for Windows

[Non-Windows users can skip this section; Windows users who have
a Python interpreter already installed (version 3.8 or higher) can
skip this section, too.]

@command{convert-ly} is actually a Python script called
@file{convert-ly.py}.  In the LilyPond binary bundle for Windows
it is located in the same directory as the @file{lilypond.exe}
binary and a Python interpreter, @file{python.exe}.  Assuming that
you have unpacked version @version{} within a directory
@file{C:\Users\me} and @env{PATH} is correctly set up, it would be
still necessary to say

@example
python C:\Users\me\lilypond-@version{}\bin\convert-ly.py myfile.ly
@end example

@noindent
which is tedious to type.

Three steps are necessary to allow the omission of both the
interpreter (@file{python.exe}) and the @file{.py}
extension.@footnote{Note that steps 1 and 2 must be done using the
default command prompt, @file{cmd.exe}, and not using PowerShell!}

@enumerate
@item
On the command line, say

@example
assoc .py=PythonScript
@end example

@noindent
to associate the extension @file{.py} with the file type
@q{PythonScript}.

@item
As the next command, say

@example
ftype PythonScript=C:\Users\me\lilypond-@version{}\bin\python.exe %1 %*
@end example

@noindent
to make files of type @q{PythonScript} be handled by LilyPond's
@command{python.exe}.  You have to adjust the path to the actual
location, and don't omit the trailing @samp{%1 %*}!

@item
Modify the @env{PATHEXT} environment variable and add @file{.py}
to already present entries.  Do this in exactly the same way as
you have already done with @env{PATH}.

@end enumerate

Now close the command line and open it again, then test whether
@code{convert-ly --version} works.


@node Invoking convert-ly
@section Invoking @command{convert-ly}

The @command{convert-ly} command uses the @code{\version} number
in the input file to detect older versions.  In most cases it is
sufficient just to run

@example
convert-ly -e myfile.ly
@end example

@noindent
in the directory containing the input file; this upgrades
@file{myfile.ly} in-place and preserves the original file by
renaming it to @file{myfile.ly~}.  The @code{\version} number in
the upgraded input file, along with any required syntax updates,
is also changed.

When run, the @command{convert-ly} command outputs the version
numbers of which conversions have been made to.  If no version
numbers are listed in the output for the file, it is already up to
date and using the latest LilyPond syntax.

@warning{For each new version of LilyPond, a new
@command{convert-ly} command is created.  However, not every
version of LilyPond needs syntax changes for its input files from
the version before.  This means that the @command{convert-ly}
command only converts input files up to the latest syntax change
it has and this, in turn, may mean that the @code{@bs{}version}
number left in the upgraded input file is sometimes lower than the
version of the @command{convert-ly} command itself.}

To convert all input files in a single directory, use

@example
convert-ly -e *.ly
@end example

@noindent
as a command.  To handle all input files that reside in different
subdirectories, try

@example
find . -name '*.ly' -exec convert-ly -e '@{@}' \;
@end example

@noindent
to recursively search and convert them in the current directory
and all directories below it.  The converted files will be located
in the same directory along with their renamed originals.

On Windows, execute

@example
forfiles /s /M *.ly /c "cmd /c convert-ly -e @@file"
@end example

@noindent
instead.  The @command{forfiles} command also accepts an explicit
path to the top level of your folder containing all the
sub-folders that have input files in them by using the @option{/p}
option.

@smallexample
forfiles /s /p C:\Documents\MyScores /M *.ly /c "cmd /c convert-ly -e @@file"
@end smallexample

If there are spaces in the path to the top-level folder, the whole
path needs to be inside double quotes, for example

@smallexample
forfiles /s /p "C:\Documents\My Scores" /M *.ly /c "cmd /c convert-ly -e @@file"
@end smallexample


@node Command-line options for convert-ly
@section Command-line options for @command{convert-ly}

The program is invoked as follows:

@example
convert-ly [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{filename}@dots{}
@end example

@noindent
By default, @command{convert-ly} writes its data to standard
output.

The following options can be given:

@table @code
@item --version
Show version number and exit.

@item -h, --help
Show usage help and exit.

@item -d, --diff-version-update
Increase the @code{\version} string only if the file has actually
been changed.  In that case, the version header will correspond to
the version after the last actual change.  An unstable version
number will be rounded up to the next stable version number unless
that would exceed the target version number.  Without this option,
the version will instead reflect the last @emph{attempted}
conversion.

@item -e, --edit
Apply the conversions directly to the input file, modifying it
in-place.  If the original file is called @file{myfile.ly}, a
backup is retained under the name @file{myfile.ly~}, i.e., a tilde
character gets appended.  This backup file may be a hidden file on
some operating systems.

If you want the converted output to be stored under a different
name, redirect the standard output to a file.

@example
convert-ly myfile.ly > mynewfile.ly
@end example

@noindent
See also option @option{--backup-numbered}.

@item -b, --backup-numbered
When used with the @samp{-e} option, number the backup files so
that no previous version is overwritten.  Assuming the input file
is called @file{myfile.ly}, try to store the backup in
@file{myfile.ly.~1~}.  If it exists, try @file{myfile.ly.~2~}
instead, etc.  The backup files may be hidden on some operating
systems.

@item -f, --from=@var{from-patchlevel}
Set the version to convert from.  If this is not set,
@command{convert-ly} will guess it on the basis of the (first)
@code{\version} string in the file.  Example:
@option{--from=2.10.25}

@item -h, --help
Print usage help.

@item -l @var{loglevel}, --loglevel=@var{loglevel}
Set the output verbosity to @var{loglevel}.  Possible values, in
upper case, are @code{PROGRESS} (the default), @code{NONE},
@code{WARNING}, @code{ERROR}, and @code{DEBUG}.

@item -n, --no-version
Normally, @command{convert-ly} adds a @code{\version} indicator
to the output.  Specifying this option suppresses this.

@item -c, --current-version
By default, @command{convert-ly} updates the @code{\version}
string to the lowest necessary version.  If this option is given,
the current LilyPond version (@version{}) is used instead.

@item -s, --show-rules
Show conversion descriptions and exit.  The amount of information
can be adjusted with options @option{--from} and @option{--to}.

@item -t, --to=@var{to-patchlevel}
Explicitly set which @code{\version} to convert to, otherwise the
default is the most current value.  It must be higher than the
starting version.

@example
convert-ly --to=2.14.1 myfile.ly
@end example

@item -v, --verbose
Display rule descriptions during conversion.

@item -w, --warranty
Show warranty and copyright and exit.

@end table

To upgrade LilyPond fragments in Texinfo files, use

@example
convert-ly --from=@dots{} --to=@dots{} --no-version *.itely
@end example

To see the changes in the LilyPond syntax between two versions, use

@example
convert-ly --from=@dots{} --to=@dots{} -s
@end example


@node Problems running convert-ly
@section Problems running @code{convert-ly}

If an input (or output) file name contains spaces it is necessary to surround the
file name with double quotes.

@example
convert-ly "D:/My Scores/Ode.ly" > "D:/My Scores/new Ode.ly"
@end example

If the invocation of @command{convert-ly -e *.ly} fails because
the expanded command line becomes too long, the
@command{convert-ly} command may be placed in a loop instead.
This example for UNIX upgrades all @file{.ly} files in the current
directory

@example
for f in *.ly; do convert-ly -e $f; done
@end example

For Windows, the corresponding command is

@example
for %x in (*.ly) do convert-ly.py -e "%x"
@end example

@noindent
in the command prompt window.

As discussed earlier, not all language changes are handled.  In
particular, automatically updating Scheme and LilyPond Scheme
interfaces is quite unlikely; be prepared to tweak Scheme code
manually.


@node Manual conversions
@section Manual conversions

In theory, a program like @command{convert-ly} could handle any
syntax change.  After all, a computer program interprets the old
version and the new version, so another computer program can
translate one file into another.@footnote{At least, this is
possible in any LilyPond file that does not contain Scheme code.
Otherwise the LilyPond file contains a Turing-complete language,
and we run into problems with the famous @qq{Halting Problem} in
computer science.}

However, the LilyPond project has limited resources: not all
conversions are performed automatically.  If @command{convert-ly}
is not able to handle a syntax change, it emits a warnings like
the following (from the 2.23.12 conversion rule).

@example
Not smart enough to convert music following \fine.

Warning: \fine no longer enforces the end of the music.
If your piece has music following \fine that you want to
exclude when it is unfolded, use \volta to exclude it.
Please refer to the manual for details, and update manually.
@end example


@node Writing code to support multiple versions
@section Writing code to support multiple versions

In some cases, especially when writing @emph{library} code it is desirable
to support multiple LilyPond versions across breaking syntax changes.  To
do this alternative portions of code can be wrapped into conditional
expressions depending on the currently executed LilyPond version.  The
Scheme function @code{ly:version?} expects a comparison operator @var{op}
and a reference version @var{ver} passed as a list of integers with up to
three elements.  Missing elements are ignored so @code{'(2 20)} is
equivalent to @emph{any} version of the 2.20 line of versions.
Constructs like the following are possible:

@example
#(cond
  ((ly:version? > '(2 20))
   (ly:message "This is code to run for LilyPond after 2.20"))
  ((ly:version? = '(2 19 57))
   (ly:message "This will only be executed with LilyPond 2.19.57"))
  (else (ly:message "This will be executed in any other version")))
@end example

Usually this will be integrated in library functions to allow alternative
syntax to be used, but it is also possible to use the comparison directly
within the music like in the following example:

@example
@{
  c' d' e' f'
  #(if (ly:version? = '(2 21))
       #@{ \override NoteHead.color = #red #@}
       #@{ \override NoteHead.color = #blue #@})
  g' a' b' c''
@}
@end example

@strong{Note:} This function has been introduced in LilyPond 2.21.80, so
it is not possible to compare with versions earlier than that.
