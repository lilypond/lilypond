to Ian Hulin who was one of the first systematically working on
our numerous roadblocks for Guile 2 migration after tackling a few
other high-level problems.  In the time spans where his health
permitted it, he was able to significantly reduce the amount of
remaining problems for the Guile 2 migration after having started
working on them in 2010, making the goal that we finally reached
now more tangible for others to work on after he left us in 2015.

@subheading Two LilyPond projects in Google Summer of Code 2016  @emph{April 23, 2016}

We are happy to see two students, Nathan Chou and Jeffery Shivers, working on
LilyPond as participants in the Google Summer of Code this year.  We hope they
produce great results and stay in the developer community afterwards.

Nathan will tackle an annoying limitation, namely the unability of spanners
to cross voices.  His work will make a class of ugly workarounds obsolete.
Jeffery will bring the ScholarLY package[1] to production quality and add a
LaTeX package to it, making it possible to create beautiful critical reports
from data encoded directly in the LilyPond score.

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.18.0.
LilyPond is a music engraving program devoted to producing the
highest-quality sheet music possible.  It brings the aesthetics of
traditionally engraved music to computer printouts.

Among the numerous improvements and changes, the following might
be most visible:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Many items are now positioned using their actual outline rather
than a@tie{}rectangular bounding box.  This greatly reduces
the occurrence of unsightly large gaps.

@item
Sets and overrides can now use the syntax
@example
\override Voice.TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = "rit."
@end example
instead of the previous
@example
\override Voice.TextSpanner #'(bound-details left text) = "rit."
@end example

@item
Triplets with a given group length can now be written as
@example
\tuplet 3/2 4 @{ c8 c c  c c c @}
@end example
instead of
@example
\times 2/3 @{ c8 c c @}  \times 2/3 @{ c8 c c @}
@end example
@end itemize

A full list of noteworthy new features is given in:

@example

LilyPond 2.3.16 was released. It fixes a couple of annoying
bugs, and has an important addition in the slur-formatter. Slurs that
pass note heads much closer than the average distance get an extra
penalty. This fixes a lot of difficult slurring cases. See
input/regression/new-slur for some examples.
Please consider this release as a 3.0 pre-release so try to find as
many bugs as possible. A report including a small .ly example
can be filed at bug-lilypond@@gnu.org
In this case, a bug is defined as something that the current 2.3 does
worse than the latest 2.2 release.  We want to be sure that no output
will get uglier by upgrading to 3.0, so that once 3.0 is out, nothing
will hold users back in switching.

LilyPond 2.3.15 was released. It fixes for some gaffes with
the new vertical spacing engine, has lots of documentation
updates, and has support for landscape output in the direct
postscript output. Also, the types of events quoted with
`\quote' can now be tuned with `quotedEventTypes'. By default,
only notes and rests end up in quotes.

LilyPond 2.3.14 was released and has exciting features!
LilyPond will try to keep staves at the same distances across a

other.

LilyPond now has a Documentation
Editor, Graham Percival. From now on, he will oversee that
useful information flows from the mailiing list into the
manual. Also, if there are unclear sections in the manual,
let him know via one of the mailing lists.
As a start of his career, he worked to transform the
"Templates" section of the website into a readable and comprehensive
chapter of the user manual.
A lot of cheers for Graham!

LilyPond 2.3.13 was released. The new slur code was
improved, scripts can be made to avoid slurs, by setting
inside-slur to #f. It is no longer necessary to instantiate
"up" and "down" staves separately when using
\autochange. Jurgen Reuter refreshed the logic around
mensural flags, so they are adjusted for staff lines once
again.

LilyPond 2.3.10 is out. This release has a major clean-up of the

means that we're halfway cleaning it out.  Incidentally, the manual
has gone from 200 to 220 pages. New features:

LilyPond 2.3.9 is out.  The important change is that lilypond
now once-again directly runs the binary. The old wrapper script has
been renamed to lilypond-latex.py, and should only be used for legacy
projects. The recommended route is either using lilypond directly
(with \book, you can have multiple movements within one document), or
to run lilypond-book with a LaTeX wrapper file.
This release also fixes a bunch of small errors.  I now consider
LilyPond feature complete for a 3.0 release.  Next on the TODO list is
updating the manual, and after that's done we can release 3.0. The
projected date for this to happen is in about a month.

LilyPond 2.3.7 was released and has new exciting features!
The slur formatting has been rewritten. The new slur code
works similar to the Beam formatter: scores are assigned for
all esthetic components of a slur. A large number of
combinations for begin and end points is then tried out.
Slurs will now also take into account collisions with staff
lines, scripts (like staccato and accent) and accidentals. In
the LilyPond emacs mode, the `|' will now display the current
beat within the measure.
