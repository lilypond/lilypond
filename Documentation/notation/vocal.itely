@cindex lyrics
@funindex \lyricmode
@cindex punctuation
@cindex spaces, in lyrics
@cindex quotes, in lyrics

@c FIXME: this section is to be rewritten.
Since LilyPond input files are text, there is at least one
issue to consider when working with vocal music:
song texts must be interpreted as text, not notes.  For example, the
input@tie{}@code{d} should be interpreted as a one letter syllable,
not the note@tie{}D.
Therefore, a special lyric mode has to be used, either explicitly
or using some abbreviated methods.

Lyrics are entered in a special input mode, which can be introduced
by the keyword @code{\lyricmode}, or by using @code{\addlyrics} or
@code{\lyricsto}.  In this mode you can enter lyrics,
with punctuation and accents, and the input @code{d} is not parsed as
a pitch, but rather as a one letter syllable.  Syllables are entered
like notes, but with pitches replaced by text.  For example,

@example
\lyricmode @{ Twin-4 kle4 twin- kle litt- le star2 @}
@end example

There are two main methods to specify the horizontal placement
of the syllables, either by specifying the duration of each syllable
explicitly, like in the example above, or by automatically aligning
the lyrics to a melody or other voice of music, using @code{\addlyrics}
or @code{\lyricsto}.
@c  TODO: broken
@c For more details see @ref{The Lyrics context}.

A word or syllable of lyrics begins with an alphabetic character, and ends
with
any space or digit.  The following characters can be any character
that is not a digit or white space.

Any character that is not a digit or white space will be regarded as
part of the syllable; one important consequence of this is that a word
can end with @code{@}}, which often leads to the following mistake:

@example
\lyricmode @{ lah- lah@}
@end example

In this example, the @code{@}} is included in the final syllable, so the
opening brace is not balanced and the input file will probably not
compile.


@funindex \property in \lyricmode

@noindent
Similarly, a period which follows an alphabetic sequence is included in
the resulting string.  As a consequence, spaces must be inserted around
property commands: do @emph{not} write

@example
\override Score.LyricText #'font-shape = #'italic
@end example

@noindent
but instead use

@example
\override Score . LyricText #'font-shape = #'italic
@end example

@funindex _
@cindex spaces, in lyrics
@cindex quotes, in lyrics
@cindex ties, in lyrics

In order to assign more than one syllable to a single note, you can
surround them with quotes or use a @code{_} character, to get spaces
between syllables, or use tilde  symbol (@code{~}) to get a lyric tie.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]
\time 3/4
\relative c' { c2 e4 g2 e4 }
\addlyrics { gran- de_a- mi- go }
\addlyrics { pu- "ro y ho-" nes- to }
\addlyrics { pu- ro~y~ho- nes- to }
@end lilypond

@noindent
The lyric tie is implemented with the Unicode character
@code{U+203F}; therefore a font that includes this glyph
(such as DejaVuLGC) has to be used.  More explanations about
text and non-text fonts can be found in @ref{Fonts}.


To enter lyrics with characters from non-English languages, or with
accented and special characters (such as the heart symbol or slanted quotes),
simply insert the characters directly into the input file and save
it with UTF-8 encoding.  See @ref{Text encoding}, for more info.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]
\relative c' { e4 f e d e f e2 }
\addlyrics { He said: “Let my peo ple go”. }
@end lilypond

To use normal quotes in lyrics, add a backslash before the
quotes.  For example,

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]
\relative c' { \time 3/4 e4 e4. e8 d4 e d c2. }
\addlyrics { "\"I" am so lone- "ly\"" said she }
@end lilypond

The full definition of a word start in Lyrics mode is somewhat more
complex.

A word in Lyrics mode begins with: an alphabetic character, @code{_},
@code{?}, @code{!}, @code{:}, @code{'}, the control characters @code{^A}
through @code{^F}, @code{^Q} through @code{^W}, @code{^Y}, @code{^^},
any 8-bit character with ASCII code over 127, or a two-character
combination of a backslash followed by one of @code{`}, @code{'},
@code{"}, or @code{^}.

@c " to balance double quotes for not-so-bright context-sensitive editors

To define variables containing lyrics, the function @code{lyricmode}
must be used.

@example
verseOne = \lyricmode @{ Joy to the world the Lord is come @}
\score @{
  <<
    \new Voice = "one" \relative c'' @{
      \autoBeamOff
      \time 2/4

@node Setting simple songs

@cindex \addlyrics

The easiest way to add lyrics to a melody is to append

@example
\addlyrics @{ @var{the lyrics} @}
@end example

@noindent
to a melody.  Here is an example,

@lilypond[ragged-right,verbatim,fragment,quote]
\time 3/4
\relative c' { c2 e4 g2. }
\addlyrics { play the game }
@end lilypond

More stanzas can be added by adding more

@lilypond[ragged-right,verbatim,fragment,quote]
\time 3/4
\relative c' { c2 e4 g2. }
\addlyrics { play the game }
\addlyrics { speel het spel }
\addlyrics { joue le jeu }
@end lilypond

The command @code{\addlyrics} cannot handle polyphony settings.  For these
cases you should use @code{\lyricsto} and @code{\lyricmode}, as will be
introduced in @ref{Lyrics explained}.

@c TODO: one additional section may be needed here,
@c such as "advanced lyric syntax" or whatever -vv

@node Working with lyrics and variables
@unnumberedsubsubsec Working with lyrics and variables

@cindex lyrics, variables

To define variables containing lyrics, the function @code{\lyricmode}
must be used.  You do not have to enter durations though, if you add
@code{\addlyrics} or @code{\lyricsto}
when invoking your variable.

@example
verseOne = \lyricmode @{ Joy to the world the Lord is come @}
\score @{
 <<
   \new Voice = "one" \relative c'' @{
     \autoBeamOff
     \time 2/4
     c4 b8. a16 g4. f8 e4 d c2
   @}
   \addlyrics @{ \verseOne @}
 >>
@}
@end example

For different or more complex orderings, the best way is to set up the
hierarchy of staves and lyrics first, e.g.,
@example
\new ChoirStaff <<
  \new Voice = "soprano" @{ @emph{music} @}
  \new Lyrics = "sopranoLyrics" @{ s1 @}
  \new Lyrics = "tenorLyrics" @{ s1 @}
  \new Voice = "tenor" @{ @emph{music} @}
>>
@end example

@noindent
and then combine the appropriate melodies and lyric lines

@example
\context Lyrics = sopranoLyrics \lyricsto "soprano"
@emph{the lyrics}
@end example

@noindent
The final input would resemble

@example
<<\new ChoirStaff << @emph{setup the music} >>
 \lyricsto "soprano" @emph{etc}
 \lyricsto "alto" @emph{etc}
@emph{etc}
>>
@end example

@ignore
@c FIXME
http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/detail?id=329
The problem cannot be reproduced.
The following has no sense, because the issue seems to be fixed.
A comment is in tracker waiting for response ---FV


Be careful when defining a variable with lyrics that creates a new
context, for example, using the deprecated @code{\lyrics} command. See
the next erroneous example:

@example
words = \lyrics{ %warning: this creates a new context
 one two
}
<<
  \new Voice = "sop" { c1 }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "sop" { \words }
  \new Voice = "alt" { c2 c }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "alt" { \words }
>>
@end example

the problem is that \lyricsto will try to connect the "sop" melody with the context
created by "\new Lyrics".

Then \lyrics in \words creates another context, and the original "\new Lyrics" one
remains empty.

@node Aligning lyrics to a melody
@subsection Aligning lyrics to a melody

@funindex \lyricmode
@funindex \addlyrics
@funindex \lyricsto

@c FIXME: this stuff is to be rewritten. -vv

Aligning of text with melodies can be made automatically, but if you
specify the durations of the syllables it can also be made manually.
Lyrics aligning and typesetting are prepared with the help of skips,
hyphens and extender lines.

Lyrics are printed by interpreting them in the context called
@code{Lyrics}; see @rinternals{Lyrics}, for more.

@example
\new Lyrics \lyricmode @dots{}
@end example

There are two main methods to specify the horizontal placement
of the syllables:

@itemize
@item
by automatically aligning
the lyrics to a melody or other voice of music, using @code{\addlyrics}
or @code{\lyricsto}

@item
or by specifying the duration of each syllable
explicitly, using @code{\lyricmode}
@end itemize

The @code{Voice} context containing the melody to which the lyrics
are being aligned must not have @qq{died}, or the lyrics after that
point will be lost.  This can happen if there are periods when that
voice has nothing to do.  For methods of keeping contexts alive, see
@ref{Keeping contexts alive}.

@node Automatic syllable durations
@unnumberedsubsubsec Automatic syllable durations

@cindex automatic syllable durations
@cindex lyrics and melodies

The lyrics can be aligned under a given melody
automatically.  This is achieved by combining the
melody and the lyrics with the @code{\lyricsto} expression

@example
\new Lyrics \lyricsto @var{name} @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
This aligns the lyrics to the
notes of the @code{Voice} context called @var{name}, which must
already exist.  Therefore normally the @code{Voice} is specified first, and
then the lyrics are specified with @code{\lyricsto}.  The command
@code{\lyricsto} switches to @code{\lyricmode} mode automatically, so the
@code{\lyricmode} keyword may be omitted.

The following example uses different commands for entering lyrics.

@lilypond[quote,fragment,ragged-right,verbatim]
<<
  \new Voice = "one" \relative c'' {
    \autoBeamOff
    \time 2/4
    c4 b8. a16 g4. f8 e4 d c2
  }

% not recommended: left-aligned syllables
  \new Lyrics \lyricmode { Joy4 to8. the16 world!4. the8 Lord4 is come.2 }

% wrong: durations needed
  \new Lyrics \lyricmode { Joy to the earth! the Sa -- viour reigns. }

%correct
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "one" { No more let sins and sor -- rows grow. }
>>
@end lilypond

The second stanza is not properly aligned because the durations
were not specified.  A solution for that would be to use @code{\lyricsto}.

The @code{\addlyrics} command is actually just a convenient way
to write a more complicated LilyPond structure that sets up the
lyrics.

@example
@{ MUSIC @}
\addlyrics @{ LYRICS @}
@end example

@noindent
is the same as

@example
\new Voice = "blah" @{ music @}
\new Lyrics \lyricsto "blah" @{ LYRICS @}
@end example

@node Manual syllable durations
@unnumberedsubsubsec Manual syllable durations

Lyrics can also be entered without @code{\addlyrics} or
@code{\lyricsto}.  In this case,
syllables are entered like notes -- but with pitches replaced by text -- and the
duration of each syllable must be entered explicitly.  For example:

@example
play2 the4 game2.
sink2 or4 swim2.
@end example

The alignment to a melody can be specified with the
@code{associatedVoice} property,

@example
\set associatedVoice = #"lala"
@end example

@noindent
The value of the property (here: @code{"lala"}) should be the name of
a @code{Voice} context.  Without this setting, extender lines
will not be formatted properly.

Here is an example demonstrating manual lyric durations,

@lilypond[relative=1,ragged-right,verbatim,fragment,quote]
<< \new Voice = "melody" {
    \time 3/4
    c2 e4 g2.
 }
 \new Lyrics \lyricmode {

   play2 the4 game2.

@cindex melisma
@cindex melismata
@cindex phrasing, in lyrics

Sometimes, particularly in Medieval music, several notes are to be sung on one
single syllable; such vocalises are called melismas, or melismata.

@c this method seems to be the simplest; therefore
@c it might be better to present it first - vv

You can define melismata entirely in the lyrics, by entering @code{_}
for every extra note that has to be added to the melisma.

@c FIXME: clarify: __ is used to crate a lyric extender,
@c _ is used to add a note to a melisma, so both __ and _ are needed.

@c verbose! --FV
@c duplicated: TODO fix
Additionaly, you can make an extender line to be typeset to indicate
the melisma in the score, writing a double underscore next to the
first syllable of the melisma. This example shows the three elements
that are used for this purpose (all of them surrounded by spaces):
double hyphens to separate syllables in a word, underscores to add
notes to a melisma, and a double underscore to put an extender line.

@c wrong: extender line only on last syllable of a word. Change example
@lilypond[relative=1,verbatim,fragment,quote]
{ \set melismaBusyProperties = #'()
 c d( e) f f( e) e e  }
\addlyrics
 { Ky -- _ _ ri __ _ _ _  e }
@end lilypond

In this case, you can also have ties and slurs in the melody if you
set @code{melismaBusyProperties}, as is done in the example above.

However, the @code{\lyricsto} command can also
detect melismata automatically: it only puts one
syllable under a tied or slurred group of notes.  If you want to force
an unslurred group of notes to be a melisma, insert @code{\melisma}
after the first note of the group, and @code{\melismaEnd} after the
last one, e.g.,

@lilypond[quote,relative=2,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]
<<
  \new Voice = "lala" {
    \time 3/4
    f4 g8
    \melisma
    f e f
    \melismaEnd
    e2
  }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "lala" {
    la di __ daah
  }
>>
@end lilypond

In addition, notes are considered a melisma if they are manually
beamed, and automatic beaming (see @ref{Setting automatic beam
behavior}) is switched off.

Making a lyric line run slower than the melody can be achieved by

@code{\skip} is used in lyrics.

@c leave this as samp. -gp
In the last syllable of a word, melismata are sometimes indicated with
a long horizontal line starting in the melisma syllable, and ending in
the next one.  Such a line is called an extender line, and it is
entered as @samp{ __ } (note the spaces before and after the two
underscore characters).

@warning{Melismata are indicated in the score with extender lines,
which are entered as one double underscore; but short melismata can
also be entered by skipping individual notes, which are entered as
single underscore characters; these do not make an extender line to be
typeset by default.}

@cindex hyphens

@c leave this as samp. -gp
Centered hyphens are entered as @samp{ -- } between syllables of a same word
(note the spaces before and after the two hyphen characters).  The hyphen
will be centered between the syllables, and its length will be adjusted
depending on the space between the syllables.

In tightly engraved music, hyphens can be removed.  Whether this
happens can be controlled with the @code{minimum-distance} (minimum
distance between two syllables) and the @code{minimum-length}
(threshold below which hyphens are removed).

@node Lyrics independent of notes
@unnumberedsubsubsec Lyrics independent of notes

@cindex Devnull context

In some complex vocal music, it may be desirable to place
lyrics completely independently of notes.  Music defined
inside @code{lyricrhythm} disappears into the
@code{Devnull} context, but the rhythms can still be used
to place the lyrics.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,ragged-right]
voice = {
  c''2
  \tag #'music { c''2 }
  \tag #'lyricrhythm { c''4. c''8 }
  d''1
}

  \new Staff { c'8 c' c' c' c' c' c' c'
  c' c' c' c' c' c' c' c' }
>>
@end lilypond

This method is recommended only if the music in the @code{Devnull}
context does not contain melismata.  Melismata are defined by the
@code{Voice} context. Connecting lyrics to a @code{Devnull} context
makes the voice/lyrics links to get lost, and so does the info on
melismata.  Therefore, if you link lyrics to a @code{Devnull} context,
the implicit melismata get ignored.

@cindex stanza number

Stanza numbers can be added by setting @code{stanza}, e.g.,

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim,relative=2,fragment]
\new Voice {
  \time 3/4 g2 e4 a2 f4 g2.
} \addlyrics {
  \set stanza = #"1. "
  Hi, my name is Bert.
} \addlyrics {
  \set stanza = #"2. "
  Oh, ché -- ri, je t'aime
}
@end lilypond


@noindent
These numbers are put just before the start of the first syllable.

@c TODO Create and add snippet to show how two lines of a
@c stanza can be grouped together, along these lines:
@c (might need improving a bit) -td

@ignore
leftbrace = \markup { \override #'(font-encoding . fetaBraces) \lookup
#"brace105" }

stanzaOneOne = {
  \set stanza = \markup { "1. " \leftbrace }
  \lyricmode { Child, you're mine and I love you.
    Lend thine ear to what I say.

  }
}

stanzaOneThree =  {
%  \set stanza = \markup { "   "}
  \lyricmode { Child, I have no great -- er joy
    Than to have you walk in truth.

  }
}

\new Voice {
  \repeat volta 2 { c'8 c' c' c' c' c' c'4
                    c'8 c' c' c' c' c' c'4   }
}  \addlyrics { \stanzaOneOne }
   \addlyrics { \stanzaOneThree }

@node Adding dynamics marks to stanzas
@unnumberedsubsubsec Adding dynamics marks to stanzas

Stanzas differing in loudness may be indicated by putting a
dynamics mark before each stanza.  In LilyPond, everything coming in
front of a stanza goes into the @code{StanzaNumber} object; dynamics marks
are no different.  For technical reasons, you have to set the stanza
outside @code{\lyricmode}:

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
text = {
  \set stanza = \markup { \dynamic "ff" "1. " }
  \lyricmode {
    Big bang
  }
}

<<
  \new Voice = "tune" {
    \time 3/4
    g'4 c'2
  }
\new Lyrics \lyricsto "tune" \text
>>
@end lilypond

@node Adding singers' names to stanzas
@unnumberedsubsubsec Adding singers' names to stanzas

@cindex singer name
@cindex name of singer

Names of singers can also be added.  They are printed at the start of
the line, just like instrument names.  They are created by setting
@code{vocalName}.  A short version may be entered as @code{shortVocalName}.

@lilypond[fragment,ragged-right,quote,verbatim,relative=2]
\new Voice {
  \time 3/4 g2 e4 a2 f4 g2.
} \addlyrics {
  \set vocalName = #"Bert "
  Hi, my name is Bert.
} \addlyrics {
  \set vocalName = #"Ernie "
  Oh, ché -- ri, je t'aime
}
@end lilypond

@subsubheading Ignoring melismata

One possibility is that the text has a melisma in one stanza, but
multiple syllables in another one.  One solution is to make the faster
voice ignore the melisma.  This is done by setting
@code{ignoreMelismata} in the Lyrics context.

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,quote]
<<
  \relative c' \new Voice = "lahlah" {
    \set Staff.autoBeaming = ##f
    c4
    \slurDotted
    f8.[( g16])
    a4
  }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "lahlah" {
    more slow -- ly
  }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "lahlah" {
    go
    \set ignoreMelismata = ##t
    fas -- ter
    \unset ignoreMelismata
    still
  }
>>
@end lilypond

@knownissues
Unlike most @code{\set} commands, @code{\set ignoreMelismata} does
not work if prefixed with @code{\once}.  It is necessary to use
@code{\set} and @code{\unset} to bracket the lyrics where melismata
are to be ignored.

@subsubheading Switching to an alternative melody

More complex variations in text underlay are possible.  It is possible
to switch the melody for a line of lyrics during the text.  This is
done by setting the @code{associatedVoice} property.  In the example

@lilypond[ragged-right,quote]
<<
  \relative c' \new Voice = "lahlah" {
    \set Staff.autoBeaming = ##f
    c4
    <<
      \new Voice = "alternative" {
        \voiceOne
        \times 2/3 {
          % show associations clearly.
          \override NoteColumn #'force-hshift = #-3
          f8 f g
        }
      }
      {
        \voiceTwo
        f8.[ g16]
        \oneVoice
      } >>
    a8( b) c
  }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "lahlah" {
    Ju -- ras -- sic Park
  }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "lahlah" {
    % Tricky: need to set associatedVoice
    % one syllable too soon!
    \set associatedVoice = alternative % applies to "ran"
    Ty --
    ran --
    no --
    \set associatedVoice = lahlah % applies to "rus"
    sau -- rus Rex
  } >>
@end lilypond

@noindent
the text for the first stanza is set to a melody called @q{lahlah},

@example
\new Lyrics \lyricsto "lahlah" @{
  Ju -- ras -- sic Park
@}
@end example


The second stanza initially is set to the @code{lahlah} context, but
for the syllable @q{ran}, it switches to a different melody.
This is achieved with
@example
\set associatedVoice = alternative
@end example

@noindent
Here, @code{alternative} is the name of the @code{Voice} context
containing the triplet.

@c FIXME: make this easier to understand -vv
This command must be one syllable too early, before @q{Ty} in this
case.  In other words, changing the associatedVoice happens one step
later than expected.  This is for technical reasons, and it is not a
bug.

@example
\new Lyrics \lyricsto "lahlah" @{
  \set associatedVoice = alternative % applies to "ran"
  Ty --
  ran --
  no --
  \set associatedVoice = lahlah % applies to "rus"
  sau -- rus Rex
@}
@end example

@noindent
The underlay is switched back to the starting situation by assigning
@code{lahlah} to @code{associatedVoice}.


@node Printing stanzas at the end
@unnumberedsubsubsec Printing stanzas at the end

Sometimes it is appropriate to have one stanza set
to the music, and the rest added in verse form at
the end of the piece.  This can be accomplished by adding
the extra verses into a @code{\markup} section outside
of the main score block.  Notice that there are two
different ways to force linebreaks when using
@code{\markup}.

@lilypond[ragged-right,verbatim,quote]
melody = \relative c' {
e d c d | e e e e |
d d e d | c1 |
}

text = \lyricmode {
\set stanza = #"1." Ma- ry had a lit- tle lamb,
its fleece was white as snow.
}

\score{ <<
  \new Voice = "one" { \melody }
  \new Lyrics \lyricsto "one" \text
>>
  \layout { }
}
\markup { \column{
  \line{ Verse 2. }
  \line{ All the children laughed and played }
  \line{ To see a lamb at school. }
  }
}
\markup{
  \wordwrap-string #"
  Verse 3.

  Mary took it home again,

  It was against the rule."
}

@node Printing stanzas at the end in multiple columns
@unnumberedsubsubsec Printing stanzas at the end in multiple columns

When a piece of music has many verses, they are often printed in
multiple columns across the page.  An outdented verse number often
introduces each verse.  The following example shows how to produce such
output in LilyPond.

@lilypond[ragged-right,quote,verbatim]
melody = \relative c' {
  c c c c | d d d d
}

text = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = #"1." This is verse one.
  It has two lines.
}

\score{ <<
    \new Voice = "one" { \melody }
    \new Lyrics \lyricsto "one" \text
   >>
  \layout { }
}

\markup {
  \fill-line {
    \hspace #0.1 % moves the column off the left margin;
        % can be removed if space on the page is tight
     \column {
      \line { \bold "2."
        \column {
          "This is verse two."
          "It has two lines."
        }
      }
      \hspace #0.1 % adds vertical spacing between verses
      \line { \bold "3."
        \column {
          "This is verse three."
          "It has two lines."
        }
      }
    }
    \hspace #0.1  % adds horizontal spacing between columns;
        % if they are still too close, add more " " pairs
        % until the result looks good
     \column {
      \line { \bold "4."
        \column {
          "This is verse four."
          "It has two lines."
        }
      }
      \hspace #0.1 % adds vertical spacing between verses
      \line { \bold "5."
        \column {
          "This is verse five."
          "It has two lines."
        }
      }
    }
  \hspace #0.1 % gives some extra space on the right margin;
      % can be removed if page space is tight
  }
}
