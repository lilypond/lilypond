Durations are designated by numbers and dots.  Durations are entered
as their reciprocal values.  For example, a quarter note is entered
using a @code{4} (since it is a 1/4 note), and a half note is entered
using a @code{2} (since it is a 1/2 note).  For notes longer than a
whole you must use the @code{\longa} (a double breve) and
@code{\breve} commands.  Durations as short as 128th notes may be
specified.  Shorter values are possible, but only as beamed notes.

Some durations cannot be represented with just binary durations
and dots; they can be represented only by tying two or more
notes together.  For details, see @ref{Ties}.

For ways of specifying durations for the syllables of lyrics and
ways of aligning lyrics to notes, see @ref{Vocal music}.

@node Tuplets
@unnumberedsubsubsec Tuplets

@cindex tuplets

@funindex \tuplet
@funindex tuplet

Tuplets are made from a music expression with the @code{\tuplet}
command, multiplying the speed of the music expression by a fraction:

@example
\tuplet @var{fraction} @{ @var{music} @}
@end example

@noindent
The fraction's numerator will be printed over or under the notes,
optionally with a bracket.  The most common tuplets are triplets
(3@tie{}notes sound within the duration normally allowed for@tie{}2).

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  a'2 \tuplet 3/2 { b4 4 4 }
  c4 c \tuplet 3/2 { b4 a g }
}
@end lilypond

@cindex tuplet grouping
@noindent
When entering long passages of tuplets, having to write a separate
@code{\tuplet} command for each group is inconvenient.  It is possible
to specify the duration of one tuplet group directly before the music
in order to have the tuplets grouped automatically:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  g'2 r8 \tuplet 3/2 8 { cis16 d e e f g g f e }
}
@end lilypond

@cindex tuplet bracket placement

@funindex \tupletUp
@funindex tupletUp
@funindex \tupletDown
@funindex tupletDown
@funindex \tupletNeutral
@funindex tupletNeutral

Tuplet brackets may be manually placed above or below the staff:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \tupletUp \tuplet 3/2 { c''8 d e }
  \tupletNeutral \tuplet 3/2 { c8 d e }
  \tupletDown \tuplet 3/2 { f,8 g a }
  \tupletNeutral \tuplet 3/2 { f8 g a }
}
@end lilypond

Tuplets may be nested:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \autoBeamOff
  c''4 \tuplet 5/4 { f8 e f \tuplet 3/2 { e[ f g] } } f4
}
@end lilypond

Modifying nested tuplets which begin at the same musical moment must be
done with @code{\tweak}.

To modify the duration of notes without printing a tuplet bracket, see
@ref{Scaling durations}.

@node Scaling durations
@unnumberedsubsubsec Scaling durations

@cindex scaling durations
@cindex durations, scaling

The duration of single notes, rests or chords may be multiplied by a
fraction @code{N/M} by appending @code{*N/M} (or @code{*N} if @code{M}
is 1) to the duration.  This will not affect the appearance of the
notes or rests produced, but the altered duration will be used in
calculating the position within the measure and setting the duration
in the MIDI output.  Multiplying factors may be combined like
@code{*L*M/N}.  Factors are part of the duration: if a duration is
not specified for subsequent notes, the default duration taken from
the preceding note will include any scaling factor.

In the following example, the first three notes take up exactly
two beats, but no triplet bracket is printed.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \time 2/4
  % Alter durations to triplets
  a'4*2/3 gis a
  % Normal durations
  a4 a
  % Double the duration of chord
  <a d>4*2
  % Duration of quarter, appears like sixteenth
  b16*4 c4
}
@end lilypond

The duration of spacer rests may also be modified by
a multiplier.  This is useful for skipping many measures, e.g.,
@code{s1*23}.

@cindex compressing music
@cindex expanding music

@funindex \scaleDurations
@funindex scaleDurations

Longer stretches of music may be compressed by a fraction in the
same way, as if every note, chord or rest had the fraction as a
multiplier.  This leaves the appearance of the music unchanged but
the internal duration of the notes will be multiplied by the
fraction @emph{num}/@emph{den}.  Here is an example showing how music
can be compressed and expanded:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \time 2/4
  % Normal durations
  <c'' a>4 c8 a
  % Scale music by *2/3
  \scaleDurations 2/3 {
    <c a f>4. c8 a f
  }
  % Scale music by *2
  \scaleDurations 2/1 {
    <c' a>4 c8 b
  }
}
@end lilypond

One application of this command is in polymetric
notation, see @ref{Polymetric notation}.

@seealso
Notation Reference:
@ref{Tuplets},
@ref{Invisible rests},
@ref{Polymetric notation}.

Snippets:
@rlsr{Rhythms}.

@knownissues
The calculation of the position within a measure must take into
account all the scaling factors applied to the notes within that
measure and any fractional carry-out from earlier measures.  This
calculation is carried out using rational numbers.  If an intermediate
numerator or denominator in that calculation exceeds 2^30 the
execution and typesetting will stop at that point without indicating
an error.


@node Ties
@unnumberedsubsubsec Ties

@cindex tie

@funindex ~

A tie connects two adjacent note heads of the same pitch.  The tie
in effect extends the duration of a note.

@warning{Ties should not be confused with @emph{slurs}, which
indicate articulation, or @emph{phrasing slurs}, which indicate
musical phrasing.  A tie is just a way of extending a note
duration, similar to the augmentation dot.}

A tie is entered by appending a tilde symbol (@code{~}) to the first
of each pair of notes being tied.  This indicates that the note
should be tied to the following note, which must be at the same pitch.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
{ a'2~ 4~ 16 r r8 }
@end lilypond

Ties can make use of the @q{last explicit pitch} interpretation of
isolated durations:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
{ a'2~ 4~ 16 r r8 }
@end lilypond

Ties are used either when the note crosses a bar line, or when
dots cannot be used to denote the rhythm.  Ties should also be
used when note values cross larger subdivisions of the measure:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative {
  r8 c'~ 2 r4 |
  r8^"not" c2~ 8 r4
}
@end lilypond

If you need to tie many notes across bar lines, it may be
easier to use automatic note splitting, see @ref{Automatic note
splitting}.  This mechanism automatically splits long notes, and
ties them across bar lines.

@cindex ties and chords
@cindex chords and ties

When a tie is applied to a chord, all note heads whose pitches
match are connected.  When no note heads match, no ties will be
created.  Chords may be partially tied by placing the ties inside
the chord.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative c' {
  <c e g>2~ 2 |
  <c e g>4~ <c e g c>
    <c~ e g~ b> <c e g b> |
}

When a second alternative of a repeat starts with a tied note, you
have to specify the repeated tie as follows:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \repeat volta 2 { c'' g <c e>2~ }
  \alternative {
    % First alternative: following note is tied normally
    { <c e>2. r4 }
    % Second alternative: following note has a repeated tie
    { <c e>2\repeatTie d4 c }
  }
}

@cindex rest, specifying vertical position

To explicitly specify a rest's vertical position, write a note
followed by @code{\rest}.  A rest of the duration of the note will
be placed at the staff position where the note would appear.  This
allows for precise manual formatting of polyphonic music, since the
automatic rest collision formatter will not move these rests.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative c'' {
  c4 c s c |
  s2 c |
}
@end lilypond

@cindex lyrics, skip

Spacer rests are available only in note mode and chord mode.  In
other situations, for example, when entering lyrics, the
command @code{\skip} is used to skip a musical moment.
@code{\skip} requires an explicit duration, but this is ignored if
the lyrics derive their durations from the notes in an associated
melody through @code{\addlyrics} or @code{\lyricsto}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<
  {
    a'2 \skip2 a'2 a'2
  }
  \new Lyrics {
    \lyricmode {
      foo2 \skip 1 bla2
    }
  }
>>
@end lilypond

Because @code{\skip} is a command, it does not affect the default
durations of following notes, unlike@tie{}@code{s}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<

    \repeat unfold 8 { a'4 }
  }
  {
    a'4 \skip 2 a' |

A spacer rest implicitly causes @code{Staff} and @code{Voice}
contexts to be created if none exist, just like notes and rests
do:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
{ s1 s s }
@end lilypond

@code{\skip} simply skips musical time; it creates no output of

Fingerings over multi-measure rests (e.g. @code{R1*10-4}) may result
in the fingering numeral colliding with the bar counter
numeral.

@cindex condensing rests
@cindex rest, condensing ordinary

There is no way to automatically condense multiple ordinary rests

Mid-measure time signature changes are covered in @ref{Upbeats}.

@cindex time signature visibility

Time signatures are printed at the beginning of a piece
and whenever the time signature changes.  If a change takes place
at the end of a line a warning time signature sign is printed
there.  This default behavior may be changed, see
@ref{Visibility of objects}.

Mensural time signatures are covered in
@ref{Mensural time signatures}.

@cindex time signature default settings
@cindex autobeaming properties for time signatures
@cindex beaming, time signature default properties
@funindex \overrideTimeSignatureSettings

In addition to setting the printed time signature, the @code{\time}
command also sets the values of the time-signature-based properties
@code{baseMoment}, @code{beatStructure}, and @code{beamExceptions}.
The predefined default values for these properties can be found in
@file{scm/time-signature-settings.scm}.

The default value of @code{beatStructure} can be overridden in the
@code{\time} command itself by supplying it as the optional first
argument:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\score {
  \new Staff {
    \relative {
      \time 2,2,3 7/8
      \repeat unfold 7 { c'8 } |
      \time 3,2,2 7/8
      \repeat unfold 7 { c8 } |
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond

Alternatively, the default values of all these time-signature-based
variables, including @code{baseMoment} and @code{beamExceptions},
can be set together.  The values can be set independently for several
different time signatures.  The new values take effect when a
subsequent @code{\time} command with the same value of the time
signature is executed:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\score {
  \new Staff {
    \relative c' {
      \overrideTimeSignatureSettings
        4/4        % timeSignatureFraction
        1/4        % baseMomentFraction
        3,1        % beatStructure
        #'()       % beamExceptions
      \time 4/4
      \repeat unfold 8 { c8 } |
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond

@code{\overrideTimeSignatureSettings} takes four arguments:

@enumerate

@item
@code{@var{timeSignatureFraction}}, a fraction describing the
time signature to which these values apply.

@item
@code{@var{baseMomentFraction}}, a fraction containing the numerator
and denominator of the basic timing unit for the time signature.

@item
@code{@var{beatStructure}}, a Scheme list indicating the structure
of the beats in the measure, in units of the base moment.

@item
@code{@var{beamExceptions}}, an alist containing any beaming rules
for the time signature that go beyond ending at every beat, as
described in @ref{Setting automatic beam behavior}.
@end enumerate


@cindex time signature properties, restoring default values
@cindex restoring default properties for time signatures
@funindex \revertTimeSignatureSettings

Changed values of default time signature properties can be restored
to the original values:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\score{
  \relative {
    \repeat unfold 8 { c'8 } |
    \overrideTimeSignatureSettings
      4/4        % timeSignatureFraction

    \revertTimeSignatureSettings 4/4
    \time 4/4
    \repeat unfold 8 { c8 } |
  }
}
@end lilypond

Different values of default time signature properties can be established
for different staves by moving the @code{Timing_translator} and the
@code{Default_bar_line_engraver} from the @code{Score} context to the
@code{Staff} context.

A basic metronome mark is simple to write:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative {
  \tempo 4 = 120
  c'2 d
  e4. d8 c2
}
@end lilypond

Metronome marks may also be printed as a range of two numbers:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative {
  \tempo 4 = 40 - 46
  c'4. e8 a4 g
  b,2 d4 r
}
@end lilypond

Tempo indications with text can be used instead:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative {
  \tempo "Allegretto"
    c''4 e d c
    b4. a16 b c4 r4
}
@end lilypond

Combining a metronome mark and text will automatically place the
metronome mark within parentheses:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative {
  \tempo "Allegro" 4 = 160
  g'4 c d e
  d4 b g2
}
@end lilypond

In general, the text can be any markup object:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative {
  \tempo \markup { \italic Faster } 4 = 132
  a'8-. r8 b-. r gis-. r a-. r
}
@end lilypond

A parenthesized metronome mark with no textual indication may be
written by including an empty string in the input:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative {
  \tempo "" 8 = 96
  d''4 g e c
}
@end lilypond

@funindex \markLengthOn
@funindex markLengthOn
@funindex \markLengthOff
@funindex markLengthOff

In a part for an instrument with long periods of rests,
tempo indications sometimes follow each other closely.
The command @code{\markLengthOn} provides extra horizontal space
to prevent tempo indications from overlapping, and @code{\markLengthOff}
restores the default behavior of ignoring tempo marks
for horizontal spacing.

Partial or pick-up measures, such as an @emph{anacrusis} or an
@emph{upbeat}, are entered using the @code{\partial} command:

@example
\partial @var{duration}
@end example

When @code{\partial} is used at the beginning of a score,
@code{@var{duration}} is the length of the music preceding the
first bar.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \time 3/4
  \partial 4.

}
@end lilypond

When @code{\partial} is used after the beginning of a score,
@code{@var{duration}} is the @emph{remaining} length of the
current measure.  It does not create a new numbered bar.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \set Score.barNumberVisibility = #all-bar-numbers-visible
  \override Score.BarNumber.break-visibility =
	    #end-of-line-invisible

  \time 12/8
  \partial 4.
  c8( d) e | f2.~ 4 f8 a,( c) f |
}
@end lilypond

The @code{\partial} command is @emph{required} when the time
signature changes in mid measure, but it may also be used alone.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \set Score.barNumberVisibility = #all-bar-numbers-visible
  \override Score.BarNumber.break-visibility =
	    #end-of-line-invisible

  r8 e,8 | a4 \bar "||"
  \partial 4
  r8 e8 | a4

}
@end lilypond

The @code{\partial} command sets the @code{Timing.measurePosition}
property, which is a rational number that indicates how much of
the measure has passed.

In metered music bar lines are inserted and bar numbers are calculated

desirable and can be @q{switched off} using the command
@code{\cadenzaOn}, then @q{switched back on} at the appropriate place
using @code{\cadenzaOff}.

@end lilypond

Inserting a @code{\bar} command within a cadenza does not start a new
measure, even if a bar line is printed.  So any accidentals -- which
are usually assumed to remain in force until the end of the measure --
will still be valid after the bar line printed by @code{\bar}.  If
subsequent accidentals should be printed, forced accidentals or
reminder accidentals need to be inserted manually, see
@ref{Accidentals}.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]

  % First cis is printed without alteration even if it's after a \bar

Automatic beaming is disabled by @code{\cadenzaOn}. Therefore, all

When using different time signatures in parallel, notes at the same
moment will be placed at the same horizontal location.  However, the bar
lines in the different staves will cause the note spacing to be less
regular in each of the individual staves than would be normal without
the different time signatures.

These engravers split all running notes and rests at the bar line, and
inserts ties for notes.  One of its uses is to debug complex scores: if
the measures are not entirely filled, then the ties show exactly how
much each measure is off.

The property @code{completionUnit} sets a preferred duration for
the split notes.

When automatic beaming is enabled, the placement of automatic beams
is determined by three context properties:
@code{baseMoment}, @code{beatStructure}, and @code{beamExceptions}.
The default values of these variables may be overridden as described
below, or alternatively the default values themselves may be changed
as explained in @ref{Time signature}.

If a @code{beamExceptions} rule is defined for the time signature in
force, that rule alone is used to determine the beam placement; the
values of @code{baseMoment} and @code{beatStructure} are ignored.

If no @code{beamExceptions} rule is defined for the time signature
in force, the beam placement is determined by the values of
@code{baseMoment} and @code{beatStructure}.


@subsubsubheading Beaming based on @code{baseMoment} and @code{beatStructure}

By default, @code{beamExceptions} rules are defined for most common
time signatures, so the @code{beamExceptions} rules must be disabled
if automatic beaming is to be based on @code{baseMoment} and
@code{beatStructure}.  The @code{beamExceptions} rules are disabled
by

@example
\set Timing.beamExceptions = #'()
@end example

When @code{beamExceptions} is set to @code{#'()}, either due to an
explicit setting or because no @code{beamExceptions} rules are defined
internally for the time signature in force, the ending points for
beams are on beats as specified by the context properties
@code{baseMoment} and @code{beatStructure}.  @code{beatStructure} is
a scheme list that defines the length of each beat in the measure in
units of @code{baseMoment}.  By default, @code{baseMoment} is one
over the denominator of the time signature.  By default, each unit of
length @code{baseMoment} is a single beat.

Note that there are separate @code{beatStructure} and @code{baseMoment}
values for each time signature.  Changes to these variables apply only
to the time signature that is currently in force, hence those changes
must be placed after the @code{\time} command which starts a new time
signature section, not before it.  New values given to a particular
time signature are retained and reinstated whenever that time signature
is re-established.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative c'' {

  % but let's disable them anyway to be sure

  \set Timing.baseMoment = #(ly:make-moment 1/4)
  \set Timing.beatStructure = 1,1,1,1
  a8^"changed" a a a a a a a
}
@end lilypond

Beam setting changes can be limited to specific contexts.  If no
setting is included in a lower-level context, the setting of the
enclosing context will apply.

@lilypond[quote, verbatim]
\new Staff {
  \time 7/8
  % No need to disable beamExceptions
  % as they are not defined for 7/8 time
  \set Staff.beatStructure = 2,3,2
  <<
    \new Voice = one {
      \relative {
        a'8 a a a a a a
      }
    }
    \new Voice = two {
      \relative {
        \voiceTwo
        \set Voice.beatStructure = 1,3,3
        f'8 f f f f f f
      }
    }
  >>
}
@end lilypond

When multiple voices are used the @code{Staff} context must be
specified if the beaming is to be applied to all voices in the
staff:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\time 7/8
% rhythm 3-1-1-2
% Change applied to Voice by default --  does not work correctly
% Because of autogenerated voices, all beating will
% be at baseMoment (1 . 8)
\set beatStructure = 3,1,1,2
<< \relative {a'8 a a a16 a a a a8 a} \\ \relative {f'4. f8 f f f} >>

% Works correctly with context Staff specified
\set Staff.beatStructure = 3,1,1,2
<< \relative {a'8 a a a16 a a a a8 a} \\ \relative {f'4. f8 f f f} >>
@end lilypond

The value of @code{baseMoment} can be adjusted to change
the beaming behavior, if desired. When this is done,
the value of @code{beatStructure} must be set to be
compatible with the new value of @code{baseMoment}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\time 5/8
% No need to disable beamExceptions
% as they are not defined for 5/8 time
\set Timing.baseMoment = #(ly:make-moment 1/16)
\set Timing.beatStructure = 7,3
\repeat unfold 10 { a'16 }
@end lilypond

@code{baseMoment} is a @i{moment}; a unit of musical duration.  A
quantity of type @i{moment} is created by the scheme function
@code{ly:make-moment}.  For more information about this function,
see @ref{Time administration}.

By default @code{baseMoment} is set to one over the denominator of
the time signature. Any exceptions to this default can be found in
@file{scm/time-signature-settings.scm}.

@subsubsubheading Beaming based on @code{beamExceptions}

Special autobeaming rules (other than ending a beam on a beat)
are defined in the @code{beamExceptions} property.

The value for @code{beamExceptions}, a somewhat complex Scheme
data structure, is easiest generated with the
@code{\beamExceptions} function.  This function is given one or
more manually beamed measure-length rhythmic patterns (measures
have to be separated by a bar check@tie{}@code{|} since the
function has no other way to discern the measure length).  Here is
a simple example:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative c'' {
  \time 3/16
  \set Timing.beatStructure = 2,1
  \set Timing.beamExceptions =
    \beamExceptions { 32[ 32] 32[ 32] 32[ 32] }
  c16 c c |
  \repeat unfold 6 { c32 } |
}
@end lilypond

@warning{A @code{beamExceptions} value must be @emph{complete}
exceptions list.  That is, every exception that should be applied
must be included in the setting.  It is not possible to add, remove,
or change only one of the exceptions. While this may seem cumbersome,
it means that the current beaming settings need not be known in order
to specify a new beaming pattern.}

When the time signature is changed, default values of
@code{Timing.baseMoment}, @code{Timing.beatStructure},
and @code{Timing.beamExceptions} are set.  Setting the time signature
will reset the automatic beaming settings for the @code{Timing}
context to the default behavior.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative a' {
  \time 6/8
  \repeat unfold 6 { a8 }
  % group (4 + 2)
  \set Timing.beatStructure = 4,2
  \repeat unfold 6 { a8 }
  % go back to default behavior
  \time 6/8
  \repeat unfold 6 { a8 }
}
@end lilypond

The default automatic beaming settings for a time signature
are determined in @file{scm/time-signature-settings.scm}.
Changing the default automatic beaming settings
for a time signature is described in @ref{Time signature}.

Many automatic beaming settings for a time signature contain an
entry for @code{beamExceptions}.  For example, 4/4 time tries to
beam the measure in two if there are only eighth notes.  The
@code{beamExceptions} rule can override the @code{beatStructure} setting
if @code{beamExceptions} is not reset.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\time 4/4
\set Timing.baseMoment = #(ly:make-moment 1/8)
\set Timing.beatStructure = 3,3,2
% This won't beam (3 3 2) because of beamExceptions
\repeat unfold 8 {c''8} |
% This will beam (3 3 2) because we clear beamExceptions
\set Timing.beamExceptions = #'()
\repeat unfold 8 {c''8}
@end lilypond

In a similar fashion, eighth notes in 3/4 time are beamed as a full
measure by default.  To beam eighth notes in 3/4 time on the beat,
reset @code{beamExceptions}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\time 3/4
% by default we beam in (6) due to beamExceptions
\repeat unfold 6 {a'8} |
% This will beam (1 1 1) due to default baseMoment and beatStructure
\set Timing.beamExceptions = #'()
\repeat unfold 6 {a'8}
@end lilypond

In engraving from the Romantic and Classical periods,
beams often begin midway through the measure in 3/4 time,
but modern practice is to avoid the false impression of 6/8 time
(see Gould, p. 153).  Similar situations arise in 3/8 time.
This behavior is controlled by the context property @code{beamHalfMeasure},
which has effect only in time signatures with 3 in the numerator:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative a' {
  \time 3/4
  r4. a8 a a |
  \set Timing.beamHalfMeasure = ##f
  r4. a8 a a |
}
@end lilypond

@subsubsubheading How automatic beaming works

When automatic beaming is enabled, the placement of automatic beams
is determined by the context properties
@code{baseMoment}, @code{beatStructure}, and @code{beamExceptions}.

The following rules, in order of priority, apply when determining
the appearance of beams:

@itemize
@item
If a manual beam is specified with @code{[@dots{}]} set the beam
as specified, otherwise

@item
if a beam-ending rule is defined in @code{beamExceptions}
for the beam-type, use it to determine the valid places where
beams may end, otherwise

@item
if a beam-ending rule is defined in @code{beamExceptions}
for a longer beam-type, use it to determine the valid places
where beams may end, otherwise

@item
use the values of @code{baseMoment} and @code{beatStructure} to
determine the ends of the beats in the measure, and
end beams at the end of beats.

@end itemize

In the rules above, the @emph{beam-type} is the duration of the
shortest note in the beamed group.

The default beaming rules can be found in
@file{scm/time-signature-settings.scm}.

@knownissues
If a score ends while an automatic beam has not been ended and is
still accepting notes, this last beam will not be typeset at all.
The same holds for polyphonic voices, entered with
@code{<< @dots{} \\ @dots{} >>}.  If a polyphonic voice ends while an
automatic beam is still accepting notes, it is not typeset.
The workaround for these problems is to manually beam the last
beam in the voice or score.

By default, the @code{Timing} translator is aliased to the
@code{Score} context.  This means that setting the time signature
in one staff will affect the beaming of the other staves as well.
Thus, a time signature setting in a later staff will reset custom
beaming that was set in an earlier staff.
One way to avoid this problem is to set the time signature
in only one staff.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<
  \new Staff {
    \time 3/4
    \set Timing.baseMoment = #(ly:make-moment 1/8)
    \set Timing.beatStructure = 1,5

    \repeat unfold 6 { a'8 }
  }
  \new Staff {
    \repeat unfold 6 { a'8 }
  }
>>
@end lilypond

The default beam settings for the time signature can also be changed, so
that the desired beaming will always be used.  Changes in automatic
beaming settings for a time signature are described in
@ref{Time signature}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<
  \new Staff {

In some cases it may be necessary to override the automatic
beaming algorithm.  For example, the autobeamer will not put beams
over rests or bar lines, and in choral scores the beaming is
often set to follow the meter of the lyrics rather than the
notes.  Such beams can be specified manually by
marking the begin and end point with @code{[} and @code{]}.

Even more strict manual control with the beams can be achieved by
setting the properties @code{stemLeftBeamCount} and
@code{stemRightBeamCount}.  They specify the number of beams to
draw on the left and right side, respectively, of the next note.
If either property is set, its value will be used only once, and
then it is erased.  In this example, the last @code{f} is printed
with only one beam on the left side, i.e., the eighth-note beam of
the group as a whole.

@funindex \featherDurations
@funindex featherDurations
@funindex grow-direction

Feathered beams are used to indicate that a small group of notes
should be played at an increasing (or decreasing) tempo, without
changing the overall tempo of the piece.  The extent of the
feathered beam must be indicated manually using @code{[} and
@code{]}, and the beam feathering is turned on by specifying a
direction to the @code{Beam} property @code{grow-direction}.

If the placement of the notes and the sound in the MIDI output is to
reflect the @emph{ritardando} or @emph{accelerando} indicated by the
feathered beam the notes must be grouped as a music expression delimited
by braces and preceded by a @code{featherDurations} command which specifies
the ratio between the durations of the first and last notes in the
group.

The square brackets show the extent of the beam and the braces show
which notes are to have their durations modified.  Normally these
would delimit the same group of notes, but this is not required: the
two commands are independent.

In the following example the eight 16th notes occupy exactly the
same time as a half note, but the first note is one half as long
as the last one, with the intermediate notes gradually
lengthening.  The first four 32nd notes gradually speed up, while
the last four 32nd notes are at a constant tempo.

Bar lines delimit measures, and are also used to indicate
repeats.  Normally, simple bar lines are automatically inserted
into the printed output at places based on the current time
signature.

The simple bar lines inserted automatically can be changed to
other types with the @code{\bar} command.  For example, a closing
double bar line is usually placed at the end of a piece:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative { e'4 d c2 \bar "|." }
@end lilypond

It is not invalid if the final note in a measure does not
end on the automatically entered bar line: the note is assumed
to carry over into the next measure.  But if a long sequence
of such carry-over measures appears the music can appear compressed
or even flowing off the page.  This is because automatic line
breaks happen only at the end of complete measures, i.e., where
all notes end before the end of a measure.

@warning{An incorrect duration can cause line breaks to be
inhibited, leading to a line of highly compressed music or
music which flows off the page.}

@cindex line breaks
@cindex bar lines, invisible
@cindex measure lines, invisible

Line breaks are also permitted at manually inserted bar lines
even within incomplete measures.  To allow a line break without
printing a bar line, use the following:

@example
\bar ""
@end example

@noindent
This will insert an invisible bar line and allow (but not
force) a line break to occur at this point.  The bar number
counter is not increased.  To force a line break see
@ref{Line breaking}.

@cindex manual bar lines
@cindex manual measure lines
@cindex bar lines, manual

This and other special bar lines may be inserted manually at any
point.  When they coincide with the end of a measure they replace
the simple bar line which would have been inserted there
automatically.  When they do not coincide with the end of a measure
the specified bar line is inserted at that point in the printed
output.

Note that manual bar lines are purely visual.  They do not affect
any of the properties that a normal bar line would affect, such as
measure numbers, accidentals, line breaks, etc.  They do not affect
the calculation and placement of subsequent automatic bar lines.
When a manual bar line is placed where a normal bar line already
exists, the effects of the original bar line are not altered.

Two types of simple bar lines and five types of double bar lines are
available for manual insertion:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  f'1 \bar "|"
  f1 \bar "."
  g1 \bar "||"
  a1 \bar ".|"
  b1 \bar ".."
  c1 \bar "|.|"
  d1 \bar "|."
  e1
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
together with dotted and dashed bar lines:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  f'1 \bar ";"
  g1 \bar "!"
  a1
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
and nine types of repeat bar lines:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  f'1 \bar ".|:"
  g1 \bar ":..:"
  a1 \bar ":|.|:"
  b1 \bar ":|.:"
  c1 \bar ":.|.:"
  d1 \bar "[|:"
  e1 \bar ":|][|:"
  f1 \bar ":|]"
  g1 \bar ":|."
  a1
}
@end lilypond

Additionally, a bar line can be printed as a simple tick:
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
f'1 \bar "'" g'1
@end lilypond
However, as such ticks are typically used in Gregorian chant, it is
preferable to use @code{\divisioMinima} there instead, described in
the section @ref{Divisiones} in Gregorian chant.

Lilypond supports kievan notation and provides a special kievan
bar line:
@lilypond[quote,fragment,verbatim]
f'1 \bar "k"
@end lilypond
Further details of this notation are explained in
@ref{Typesetting Kievan square notation}.

@cindex segno

For in-line segno signs, there are three types of bar lines which
differ in their behavior at line breaks:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative c'' {
  c4 c c c
  \bar "S"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar "S"
  c4 c c c
  \bar "S-|"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar "S-|"
  c4 c c c
  \bar "S-S"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar "S-S"
  c1
}
@end lilypond

@cindex repeats

Although the bar line types signifying repeats may be inserted
manually they do not in themselves cause LilyPond to recognize
a repeated section.  Such repeated sections are better entered
using the various repeat commands (see @ref{Repeats}), which
automatically print the appropriate bar lines.

In addition, you can specify @code{".|:-||"}, which is equivalent to
@code{".|:"} except at line breaks, where it gives a double bar
line at the end of the line and a start repeat at the beginning of
the next line.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative c'' {
  c4 c c c
  \bar ".|:-||"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar ".|:-||"
  c4 c c c
}
@end lilypond

For combinations of repeats with the segno sign, there are six different
variations:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative c'' {
  c4 c c c
  \bar ":|.S"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar ":|.S"
  c4 c c c
  \bar ":|.S-S"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar ":|.S-S"
  c4 c c c
  \bar "S.|:-S"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar "S.|:-S"
  c4 c c c
  \bar "S.|:"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar "S.|:"
  c4 c c c
  \bar ":|.S.|:"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar ":|.S.|:"
  c4 c c c
  \bar ":|.S.|:-S"
  c4 c c c \break
  \bar ":|.S.|:-S"
  c1
}
@end lilypond

Additionally there is an @code{\inStaffSegno} command which creates
a segno bar line in conjunction with an appropriate repeat bar line
when used with a @code{\repeat volta} command, see
@ref{Normal repeats}.

@funindex \defineBarLine
@funindex defineBarLine
@cindex bar lines, defining
@cindex defining bar lines

New bar line types can be defined with @code{\defineBarLine}:

@example
\defineBarLine @var{bartype} #'(@var{end} @var{begin} @var{span})
@end example

The @code{\defineBarline} variables can include the
@q{empty} string @code{""}, which is equivalent to an invisible
bar line being printed.  Or they can be set to @code{#f} which
prints no bar line at all.

After the definiton, the new bar line can be used by
@code{\bar} @var{bartype}.

There are currently ten bar line elements available:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\defineBarLine ":" #'("" ":" "")
\defineBarLine "=" #'("=" "" "")
\defineBarLine "[" #'("" "[" "")
\defineBarLine "]" #'("]" "" "")

\new Staff {
  s1 \bar "|"
  s1 \bar "."
  s1 \bar "!"
  s1 \bar ";"
  s1 \bar ":"
  s1 \bar "k"
  s1 \bar "S"
  s1 \bar "="
  s1 \bar "["
  s1 \bar "]"
  s1 \bar ""
}
@end lilypond

The @code{"="} bar line provides the double span bar line, used
in combination with the segno sign.  Do not use it as a standalone
double thin bar line; here, @code{\bar} @var{"||"} is
preferred.

The @code{"-"} sign starts annotations to bar lines which
are useful to distinguish those with identical appearance
but different behavior at line breaks and/or different span bars.
The part following the @code{"-"} sign is not used for building up
the bar line.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\defineBarLine "||-dashedSpan" #'("||" "" "!!")

\new StaffGroup <<
  \new Staff \relative c'' {
    c1 \bar "||"
    c1 \bar "||-dashedSpan"
    c1
  }
  \new Staff \relative c'' {
    c1
    c1
    c1
  }
>>
@end lilypond

Furthermore, the space character @code{" "} serves as a placeholder
for defining span bars correctly aligned to the main bar lines:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\defineBarLine ":|.-wrong" #'(":|." "" "|.")
\defineBarLine ":|.-right" #'(":|." "" " |.")

\new StaffGroup <<
  \new Staff \relative c'' {
    c1 \bar ":|.-wrong"
    c1 \bar ":|.-right"
    c1
  }
  \new Staff \relative c'' {
    c1
    c1
    c1
  }
>>
@end lilypond

If additional elements are needed, LilyPond provides a simple
way to define them.  For more informations on modifying or adding
bar lines, see file @file{scm/bar-line.scm}.

In scores with many staves, a @code{\bar} command in one staff is
automatically applied to all staves.  The resulting bar lines are
connected between different staves of a @code{StaffGroup},
@code{PianoStaff}, or @code{GrandStaff}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<
  \new StaffGroup <<
    \new Staff \relative {

Bar numbers are typeset by default at the start of every line except
the first line.  The number itself is stored in the
@code{currentBarNumber} property, which is normally updated
automatically for every measure.  It may also be set manually:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]

@cindex bar numbers, regular spacing

@funindex barNumberVisibility
@funindex BarNumber

Bar numbers can be typeset at regular intervals instead of just at the
beginning of every line.  To do this the default behavior must be
overridden to permit bar numbers to be printed at places other than the
start of a line.  This is controlled by the @code{break-visibility}
property of @code{BarNumber}.  This takes three values which may be set
to @code{#t} or @code{#f} to specify whether the corresponding bar
number is visible or not.  The order of the three values is
@code{end of line visible}, @code{middle of line visible},
@code{beginning of line visible}.  In the following example bar numbers
are printed at all possible places:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative c' {
  \override Score.BarNumber.break-visibility = ##(#t #t #t)
  \set Score.currentBarNumber = #11

@unnumberedsubsubsec Bar and bar number checks

@cindex bar check
@cindex bar number check
@cindex measure check
@cindex measure number check

@funindex barCheckSynchronize
@funindex |

Bar checks help detect errors in the entered durations.  A bar check
may be entered using the bar symbol, @code{|}, at any place where a
bar line is expected to fall.  If bar check lines are encountered at
other places, a list of warnings is printed in the log file, showing
the line numbers and lines in which the bar checks failed.  In the
next example, the second bar check will signal an error.

@example
\time 3/4 c2 e4 | g2 |
@end example

An incorrect duration can result in a completely garbled score,
especially if the score is polyphonic, so a good place to start
correcting input is by scanning for failed bar checks and
incorrect durations.

If successive bar checks are off by the same musical interval,
only the first warning message is displayed.  This allows the
warning to focus on the source of the timing error.

Bar checks can also be inserted in lyrics:

@example
\lyricmode @{
  \time 2/4
  Twin -- kle | Twin -- kle |
@}
@end example

Note that bar check marks in lyrics are evaluated at the musical
moment when the syllable @emph{following} the check mark is processed.
If the lyrics are associated with the notes of a voice which has a
rest at the beginning of a bar, then no syllable can be located at the
start of that bar and a warning will be issued if a bar check mark is
placed in the lyrics at that position.


@funindex |
@funindex "|"

It is also possible to redefine the action taken when a bar check
or pipe symbol, @code{|}, is encountered in the input, so that
it does something other than a bar check.  This is done by
assigning a music expression to @code{"|"}.
In the following example @code{|} is set to insert a double bar
line wherever it appears in the input, rather than checking
for end of bar.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
"|" = \bar "||"
{
  c'2 c' |
  c'2 c'
  c'2 | c'
  c'2 c'
}
@end lilypond

@funindex \barNumberCheck
@funindex barNumberCheck

When copying large pieces of music, it can be helpful to check that
the LilyPond bar number corresponds to the original that you are
entering from.  This can be checked with @code{\barNumberCheck}, for
example,

@verbatim
\barNumberCheck #123
@end verbatim

@noindent
will print a warning if the @code{currentBarNumber} is not 123
when it is processed.

\relative c'' {
  c1 \mark \default
  c1 \mark \default
  c1 \mark \default
  c1 \mark \default
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
The mark is incremented automatically if you use @code{\mark

mark manually.  The value to use is stored in the property
@code{rehearsalMark}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative c'' {

@end lilypond

@noindent
The letter@tie{}@q{I} is skipped in accordance with engraving
traditions.  If you wish to include the letter @q{I}, then use one
of the following commands, depending on which style of rehearsal mark
you want (letters only, letters in a hollow box, or letters in a
hollow circle).

@example
\set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-alphabet
\set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-box-alphabet
\set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-circle-alphabet
@end example

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]

The style is defined by the property @code{markFormatter}.  It is
a function taking the current mark (an integer) and the current
context as argument.  It should return a markup object.  In the
following example, @code{markFormatter} is set to a pre-defined
procedure.  After a few measures, it is set to a procedure that
produces a boxed number.

for other formatting functions.

You may use @code{format-mark-barnumbers},
@code{format-mark-box-barnumbers}, and

incremented numbers or letters.

Other styles of rehearsal mark can be specified manually:

@funindex \grace
@funindex \slashedGrace
@funindex \acciaccatura
@funindex \appoggiatura

Grace notes are musical ornaments, printed in a smaller font, that take
up no additional logical time in a measure.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  c''4 \grace b16 a4(
  \grace { b16 c16 } a2)
}
@end lilypond

There are three other types of grace notes possible; the
@emph{acciaccatura} -- an unmeasured grace note indicated by a slurred
note with a slashed stem -- and the @emph{appoggiatura}, which takes a
fixed fraction of the main note it is attached to and prints without the
slash.  It is also possible to write a grace note with a slashed stem,
like the @emph{acciaccatura} but without the slur, so as to place it
between notes that are slurred themselves, using the
@code{\slashedGrace} function.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative {
  \acciaccatura d''8 c4
  \appoggiatura e8 d4
  \acciaccatura { g16 f } e2
  \slashedGrace a,8 g4
  \slashedGrace b16 a4(
  \slashedGrace b8 a2)
}
@end lilypond

The placement of grace notes is synchronized between different staves.
In the following example, there are two sixteenth grace notes for every
eighth grace note

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<
  \new Staff \relative { e''2 \grace { c16 d e f } e2 }
  \new Staff \relative { c''2 \grace { g8 b } c2 }
>>
@end lilypond

@cindex grace notes, following

@funindex \afterGrace
@funindex afterGrace

If you want to end a note with a grace, use the @code{\afterGrace}
command.  It takes two arguments: the main note, and the grace
notes following the main note.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\relative { c''1 \afterGrace d1 { c16[ d] } c1 }
@end lilypond

This will put the grace notes after a space lasting 3/4 of the
length of the main note.  The default fraction 3/4 can be changed by
setting @code{afterGraceFraction}.  The following example shows
the results from setting the space at the default,  at 15/16, and
finally at 1/2 of the main note.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<
  \new Staff \relative {
    c''1 \afterGrace d1 { c16[ d] } c1
  }
  \new Staff \relative {
    #(define afterGraceFraction (cons 15 16))
    c''1 \afterGrace d1 { c16[ d] } c1
  }
  \new Staff \relative {
    #(define afterGraceFraction (cons 1 2))
    c''1 \afterGrace d1 { c16[ d] } c1
  }
>>
@end lilypond

The space between the main note and the grace note may also be
specified using spacers.  The following example places the grace
note after a space lasting 7/8 of the main note.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\new Voice \relative {
  <<
    { d''1^\trill_( }
    { s2 s4. \grace { c16 d } }

@cindex tweaking grace notes
@cindex grace notes, tweaking
@cindex grace notes, changing layout settings

A @code{\grace} music expression will introduce special
typesetting settings, for example, to produce smaller type, and
set directions.  Hence, when introducing layout tweaks to
override the special settings, they should be placed inside
the grace expression.  The overrides should also be reverted
inside the grace expression.  Here, the grace note's default stem
direction is overridden and then reverted.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]

@c TODO Add link to LSR snippet to add slash when available

Grace note synchronization can also lead to surprises.  Staff
notation, such as key signatures, bar lines, etc., are also
synchronized.  Take care when you mix staves with grace notes and
staves without, for example,

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<
  \new Staff \relative { e''4 \bar ".|:" \grace c16 d2. }
  \new Staff \relative { c''4 \bar ".|:" d2. }
>>
@end lilypond

@noindent
This can be remedied by inserting grace skips of the corresponding
durations in the other staves.  For the above example

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
<<
  \new Staff \relative { e''4 \bar ".|:" \grace c16 d2. }
  \new Staff \relative { c''4 \bar ".|:" \grace s16 d2. }
>>
@end lilypond

Please make sure that you use the @code{\grace} command for the
spacer part, even if the visual part uses @code{\acciaccatura} or
@code{\appoggiatura} because otherwise an ugly slur fragment will
be printed, connecting the invisible grace note with the following
note.

Grace sections should only be used within sequential music expressions.
Nesting or juxtaposing grace sections is not supported, and might
produce crashes or other errors.

Each grace note in MIDI output has a length of 1/4 of its actual
duration.  If the combined length of the grace notes is greater than the
length of the preceding note a @qq{@code{Going back in MIDI time}}
error will be generated.  Either make the grace notes shorter in
duration, for example:

@example
c'8 \acciaccatura @{ c'8[ d' e' f' g'] @}
@end example

becomes:

@example
c'8 \acciaccatura @{ c'16[ d' e' f' g'] @}
@end example

Or explicitly change the musical duration:

@example
c'8 \acciaccatura @{ \scaleDurations 1/2 @{ c'8[ d' e' f' g'] @} @}
@end example

See @ref{Scaling durations}.


@node Aligning to cadenzas

@cindex cadenza

@cindex aligning to cadenza

In an orchestral context, cadenzas present a special problem: when
constructing a score that includes a measured cadenza or other solo
passage, all other instruments should skip just as many notes as the
length of the cadenza, otherwise they will start too soon or too late.

One solution to this problem is to use the functions
@code{mmrest-of-length} and @code{skip-of-length}.  These Scheme
functions take a defined piece of music as an argument and generate a
multi-measure rest or @code{\skip} exactly as long as the piece.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]

Time is administered by the @code{Timing_translator}, which by
default is to be found in the @code{Score} context.  An alias,
@code{Timing}, is added to the context in which the
@code{Timing_translator} is placed.  To ensure that the
@code{Timing} alias is available, you may need to explicitly
instantiate the containing context (such as @code{Voice} or
@code{Staff}).

The following properties of @code{Timing} are used
to keep track of timing within the score.

@cindex bar number
@cindex measure number

@table @code
@item currentBarNumber
The current measure number.  For an example showing the
use of this property see @ref{Bar numbers}.

@item measureLength
The length of the measures in the current time signature.  For a
4/4 time this is@tie{}1, and for 6/8 it is 3/4.  Its value
determines when bar lines are inserted and how automatic beams
should be generated.

@item measurePosition
The point within the measure where we currently are.  This
quantity is reset by subtracting @code{measureLength} whenever
@code{measureLength} is reached or exceeded.  When that happens,
@code{currentBarNumber} is incremented.

@item timing
If set to true, the above variables are updated for every time
step.  When set to false, the engraver stays in the current
measure indefinitely.

@end table

Timing can be changed by setting any of these variables
explicitly.  In the next example, the default 4/4 time
signature is printed, but @code{measureLength} is set to 5/4.
At 4/8 through the third measure, the @code{measurePosition} is
advanced by 1/8 to 5/8, shortening that bar by 1/8.
The next bar line then falls at 9/8 rather than 5/4.
