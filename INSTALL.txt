INSTALL - compiling and installing GNU LilyPond
***********************************************

   This document describes how to build LilyPond on Unix platforms.  It
is also known to run and compile on Windows NT/95/98 as well.  More
information on this topic can be found at the LilyPond on Windows page
(http://www.lilypond.org/gnu-windows/).

Downloading
===========

   Even numbered versions are `stable'. The webpages for the stable
version (1.4) reside the lilypond users site
(http://www.lilypond.org/stable). Big enhancements go into the latest
odd numbered version (1.5), whose webpages are on the lilypond
development site (http://www.lilypond.org/development).

source code
-----------

   If you want to compile LilyPond from source, download here:
   * Download development releases from
     `ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/' by FTP and
     `http://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/', by HTTP.

   * `ftp://sca.uwaterloo.ca/pub/' by FTP (Canadian mirror)

   * at `lilypond.org' `ftp://ftp.lilypond.org/pub/LilyPond/' by FTP and
     `http://www.lilypond.org/ftp/' by HTTP.

Anonymous CVS access

              -rlilypond_1_4 -d lilypond-1.4 lilypond

   See `http://lilypond.org/wiki/?CVS' for more information.

Binaries
--------

   Binaries are available, but are not updated for every version
released.
   * Red Hat i386
     (ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/binaries/RedHat/RPMS/)

   * LinuxPPC (ftp://ftp.lilypond.org/pub/LilyPond/binaries/linuxppc/)

   * Debian GNU/Linux
     (ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/l/lilypond/)

   * Windows Testing (http://www.lilypond.org/gnu-windows/)


Upgrading
---------

   There are two options for upgrading sources.

   * if you have an unpacked source tree of a previous version, you may
     the patches.

     _If you upgrade by patching do remember to rerun autoconf after
     applying the patch_.

   * if you have the `.tar.gz' file of a previous release, you can use
     xdelta (ftp://ftp.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/xdelta/).   This is much
     safer than using patches, and is the recommended way.

     The following command produces `lilypond-1.4.11.tar.gz' from
     `lilypond-1.4.10.tar.gz' identical (up to compression dates) to
     the .11 on the FTP site.
            xdelta patch lilypond-1.4.10-1.4.11.xd lilypond-1.4.10.tar.gz

Requirements
============

Compilation
-----------

   You need the following packages to compile Lilypond.

   * The GNU c++ compiler (version 2.95.2 or newer).  EGCS 1.1 may
     work, but is no longer supported.  Check out the gcc site
     (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/).

     WARNING: if you choose to upgrade to GCC 3.x, enquire if your
     distribution supports g++ 3.x and flex.

   * Python 1.5 or 2.1 Check out the python website
     (http://www.python.org/).

   * GUILE 1.4 or newer GUILE-1.3.4 may work but is no longer
     supported.  Check out the GUILE webpage
     (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html).

   * GNU Make.  Check out the GNU make FTP directory
     (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/).

   * Flex (version 2.5.4a or newer).  Check out the Flex webpage
     (http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/).

     WARNING: plain Flex 2.5.4(a) generates invalid C++ code.  GCC 3.x
     chokes on this.  If you wish to use GCC 3.x, make sure that your
     distribution supports g++ 3.x and flex.  For a workaround, see
     lexer-gcc-3.0 below.

   * Bison (version 1.25 or newer).  Check out the bison webpage
     (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)

   * TeX.

     TeX is used as an output backend.

     Also, TeX's libkpathsea is used to find the fonts (`.mf', `.afm',
     `.tfm').  Make sure you have tetex 1.0 or newer (1.0.6 is known to
     work).  You may need to install a tetex-devel or tetex-dev package
     too.

   * Texinfo (version 4.0 or newer).  The documentation of lily is
     written in texinfo.  Check out the texinfo FTP directory
     (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/).

   * The geometry package for LaTeX is needed to use ly2dvi.  It is
     available at the FTP directory for `geometry'
     (ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/geometry).
     This package is normally included with the TeX distribution.

   * kpathsea, a library for searching (TeX) files.  `kpathsea' is
     usually included with your installation of TeX.  You may need to
     install a tetex-devel or tetex-dev package too.

     In the very unlikely case that kpathsea is not available for your
     platform (ie, you're not running GNU/Linux, Windows, or any recent
     UNIX), you can compile LilyPond without kpathsea support.  In that
     case, you'll probably have to indicate where TeX's tfm files live.
     Invoke configure something like:

               ./configure --without-kpathsea --enable-tfm-path=/usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/cm/:/usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/ams/symbols


Running requirements
--------------------

   GNU LilyPond does use a lot of resources. For operation you need the
following software

   * TeX.

   * Xdvi and Ghostscript

   * GUILE 1.4, or newer.  Check out the GUILE webpage
     (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile.html)

   For running LilyPond successfully you have to help TeX and MetaFont
find various files.  The recommended way of doing so is adjusting the
environment variables in the start-up scripts of your shell. Appropriate
Csh and bourne sh scripts are left in
`buildscripts/out/lilypond-profile' and
`buildscripts/out/lilypond-login' after compilation.

   LilyPond is a big and slow program.  A fast CPU and plenty of RAM is
recommended for comfortable use.

Website requirements
--------------------

   The documentation comes in the form of a website. You can view this
website on the internet, but you can also build it locally. This process
requires a successful compile of lilypond. The website is built by
issuing

       make web-doc

   Building the website requires some additional tools:

   * xpmtoppm (from the netpbm package: the Portable Bitmap Utilities).
     The original is at the netpbm FTP site
     (ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/netpbm-1mar1994.p1.tar.gz)

   * pnmtopng. The original is at in the pnmtopng FTP site
     (ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/applications/pnmtopng-2.37.2.tar.gz).

   * Bibtex2html (http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ftp/bibtex2html/), or
     Bib2html (http://www.uni-koblenz.de/ag-ki/ftp/bib2html/).
     Bibtex2html is available in debian, while bib2html is in some rpm
     based distributions.  Bib2html, in turn depends on man2html for
     proper installation.  man2html can be had from
     http://askdonald.ask.uni-karlsruhe.de/hppd/hpux/Networking/WWW/Man2html-1.05
     (http://askdonald.ask.uni-karlsruhe.de/hppd/hpux/Networking/WWW/Man2html-1.05).

     The website will build without bib converter utility, but you will
     not see our hypertextified bibliography.

   * texinfo (a development release) The documentation will build with
     texinfo-4.0, but if you want split html pages, you're best off
     using the lates pretest version from texinfo-4.0b
     (ftp://texinfo.org/texinfo/pretests/texinfo-4.0b.tar.gz) or
     texinfo-4.0b (ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo-4.0b.tar.gz)

Building LilyPond
=================

   to install GNU LilyPond, type:
     	gunzip -c lilypond-x.y.z | tar xf -
     	cd lilypond-x.y.z
     	./configure		# run with --help to see appropriate options
     	make
     	make install
             sh buildscripts/clean-fonts.sh

   If you are doing an upgrade, you should remove all `feta' `.pk' and
`.tfm' files.  A script has been provided to do the work for you, see
`buildscripts/clean-fonts.sh'.

   If you are not root, you should choose a `--prefix' argument that
points into your home directory, eg.

     	./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr

   In this case, you have to insert the contents of
`buildscripts/out/lilypond-login' or
`buildscripts/out/lilypond-profile' into your start up scripts by hand.

Configuring for multiple platforms
----------------------------------

   If you want to build multiple versions of LilyPond with different
configuration settings, you can use the `--enable-config=CONF' option
of configure.  You should use `make conf=CONF' to generate the output
in `out-CONF'.  Example: suppose I want to build with and without
profiling.  Then I'd use the following for the normal build,

           ./configure --prefix=~ --enable-checking
           make
           make install

   and for the profiling version, I specify a different configuration.


           ./configure --prefix=~ --enable-profiling --enable-config=prof --disable-checking
           make conf=prof
           make conf=prof install

Emacs mode
==========

   An emacs mode for LilyPond is included with the source archive as
`lilypond-mode.el' and `lilypond-font-lock.el'.  If you have an RPM, it
is in `/usr/share/doc/lilypond-X/'.  You have to install it yourself.

   Add this to your `~/.emacs' or `~/.emacs.el':
         (load-library "lilypond-mode.el")
         (setq auto-mode-alist
           (cons '("\\.ly$" . LilyPond-mode) auto-mode-alist))
         (add-hook 'LilyPond-mode-hook (lambda () (turn-on-font-lock)))

   If you have the latest LilyPond-1.4.x Debian package, LilyPond-mode
is automatically loaded, so you need not modify your `~/.emacs' file.

Compiling for distributions
===========================

Red Hat Linux
-------------

   Red Hat 7.x i386 RPMS are available from
`ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/binaries/'.

   You can also compile them yourself.  A spec file is in
`make/out/lilypond.redhat.spec'. This file is distributed along with
the sources.  You can make the rpm by issuing

             tar xfz lilypond-x.y.z.tar.gz
     	rpm -bb lilypond-x.y.z/make/out/lilypond.redhat.spec
     	rpm -i /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/lilypond-x.y.z

   For running on a Red Hat system you need these packages: guile,
tetex, tetex-latex, tetex-dvips, libstdc++, python, ghostscript.

   For compilation on a Red Hat system you need these packages, in
addition to the those needed for running: glibc-devel, gcc-c++,
libstdc++-devel, guile-devel, flex, bison, texinfo, tetex-devel, groff,
libgr-progs.

LinuxPPC
--------

   Some LinuxPPC RPMS should available from
`ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/binaries/'.

   A LinuxPPC RPM can be made using the `lilypond.redhat.spec' file.

SuSE
----

   Some SuSE RPMS should available from
`ftp://ftp.lilypond.org/pub/LilyPond/binaries/SuSE'.

   You can also compile a RPM for SuSE yourself.  A spec file is in
`make/out/lilypond.suse.spec', see the instructions for building the
Red Hat RPM.

   You must have the following packages: guile tcsh tetex te_latex
te_kpath te_mpost libpng python gpp libgpp gettext autoconf netpbm
libnetpb gs_serv gs_lib gs_fonts guile

Slackware
---------

   No precompiled packages for Slackware are available.

   Problems have been reported with Slackware 7.0; apparently, it ships
with a faulty compiler.  Do not compile LilyPond with -O2 on this
platform.

Mandrake
--------

   Some binaries are available at rpmfind.net. Refer to
`ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/Mandrake-devel/cooker/contrib/RPMS/'.

Debian GNU/Linux
----------------

   A Debian package is also available.  You may install it easily by
running `apt-get' as root:

     	apt-get install lilypond lilypond-doc

   Debian's TeX installation is a bit short on memory, you may want to
increase it like this:
     --- /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf.dpkg	Sun Jan 28 14:12:14 2001
     +++ /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf	Fri Apr 27 11:09:35 2001
     @ -384,8 +384,8 @
      main_memory.context = 1500000
      main_memory.mpost = 1000000
      main_memory = 263000 % words of inimemory available; also applies to inimf&mp
     -extra_mem_top = 0    % extra high memory for chars, tokens, etc.
     -extra_mem_bot = 0    % extra low memory for boxes, glue, breakpoints, etc.
     +extra_mem_top = 100000    % extra high memory for chars, tokens, etc.
     +extra_mem_bot = 100000    % extra low memory for boxes, glue, breakpoints, etc.
     
      obj_tab_size.context = 256000

   You could also export `extra_mem_top' and `extra_mem_bot' as
environment variables if you do not want to or cannot modify
`/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf'.

   Alternatively, visit

   * http://packages.debian.org/lilypond
     (http://packages.debian.org/lilypond)

   * http://people.debian.org/~foka/lilypond/
     (http://people.debian.org/~foka/lilypond/) for latest
     semi-unofficial build of LilyPond 1.4.2 for Debian 2.2 (potato)
     users.  The official stable Debian 2.2 is stuck with the old
     LilyPond-1.3.24.  Since LilyPond-1.4 has been released, the older
     lilypond1.3 Debian package is now obsolete.

   Please contact Anthony Fok <lilypond@packages.debian.org> for more
information.

   The build scripts are in the subdirectory `debian/'; you can make
the .deb by doing, for example:

     	$ su - root
     	# dpkg --purge lilypond lilypond1.3
     	# exit
     	$ tar xzf lilypond-1.4.11.tar.gz
     	$ cd lilypond-1.4.11
     	$ dch -p -v 1.4.11-0.local.1 "Local build."
     	$ debuild -B
     	$ su - root
     	# dpkg -i ../lilypond_1.4.11*.deb
     	# exit
     	$

   Use command `debuild' instead of `debuild -B' if you have a very
fast machine and want to build the HTML, PS and DVI documentation too.

   For compilation on a Debian GNU/Linux system you need these packages,
in addition to the those needed for running:

   * g++, cpp, libc6-dev, libstdc++<YOUR-LIBSTDC++-VERSION-HERE>-dev

   * libguile<YOUR-LIBGUILE-VERSION-HERE>-dev

   * make, m4, flex, bison

   * gettext

   * groff, texinfo

   * bibtex2html (not in Debian 2.2)

   * tetex-base, tetex-bin, tetex-extra, libkpathsea-dev or tetex-dev

   * dpkg-dev, debhelper, fakeroot

   * gs, netpbm

   * pnmtopng (only in Debian 2.2: pnmtopng has been merged with netpbm
      in Debian testing/unstable.)

   Most of these are listed on the `Build-Depends' line in the
`debian/control' file.  To ensure the creation of the lilypond deb is
trouble-free, we recommend that you first install the following packages
by running \`apt-get' as root before building the package:

   For Debian 2.2:

     	apt-get install task-debian-devel task-c++-dev \
     		python-base libguile6-dev tetex-bin tetex-dev \
     		tetex-extra flex bison texinfo groff gs \
     		netpbm pnmtopng m4 gettext

   For Debian in development ("unstable", the future Debian 3.0):

     	apt-get install binutils cpp gcc libc6-dev \
             	g++ libstdc++2.10-dev \
     		python libguile-dev tetex-bin libkpathsea-dev \
     		tetex-extra flex bison texinfo bibtex2html groff gs \
     		netpbm m4 gettext

   And, just so that old fonts from previous versions of LilyPond won't
interfere with your build, you may want to do this before the build too:

     	dpkg --purge lilypond lilypond1.3

MacOS X
-------

   LilyPond has been built on Darwin, to be precise, on:
         Darwin buoux.aspiratie.nl 5.3 Darwin Kernel Version 5.3: Thu Jan 24
         22:06:02 PST 2002; root:xnu/xnu-201.19.obj~1/RELEASE_PPC  Power Macintosh powerpc

   using:

         Apple Computer, Inc. version gcc-932.1, based on gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)

   To make sure you have all packages needed to build LilyPond
installed, run as root:

             apt-get install bash python guile debianutils flex bison texinfo \
                     ghostscript6 netpbm m4 gettext

   and:

             fink install tetex

   For more information about `apt-get' and `fink', see
fink.sourceforge.net (http://fink.sf.net).

   Then, configure, patch, make and install LilyPond using these
commands:

             CC="cc -I/sw/include" CXX="c++ -I/sw/include" LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib" \
                 ./configure --prefix=/sw
             make -C lily out/parser.hh out/parser.cc out/config.h
             patch -p0 < darwin.patch
             make -C lily out/parser.o
             make DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT=/dev/null all
             make install

   For installing, you must be root, of course.

Problems
========

   For help and questions use <lilypond-user@gnu.org>.  Please consult
the FAQ before mailing your problems.  If you find bugs, please send
bug reports to <bug-lilypond@gnu.org>.

   Bugs that are not fault of LilyPond are documented here.

Debian GNU/Linux unstable gcc-3.0
---------------------------------

   Flex (2.5.4a-11) in unstable does not produce g++-3.0 compliant C++
code.  To compile LilyPond with gcc-3.0, please first upgrade to
flex_2.5.4a-13 or newer.  Otherwise, you may do:

             rm -f config.cache
             CC=gcc-3.0 CXX=g++-3.0 ./configure --enable-config=gcc-3.0
             make conf=gcc-3.0 -C lily out-gcc-3.0/lexer.cc
             patch -p1 < lexer-gcc-3.0.patch
             make conf=gcc-3.0 -C lily

Linux-2.4.0, Guile-1.4 -with-threads
------------------------------------

   There's a bug in certain kernels around version 2.4.0, that is
triggered when using Guile 1.4 compiled with pthreads.  You'll see
random segmentation fault craches of LilyPond.  Upgrade to a newer
version of Linux.  If you can't do that, you may try to recompiling
Guile without threads (YMMV):

              guile-1.4$ ./configure --without-threads; make all install

NetBSD
------

   * The flex precompiled in NetBSD-1.4.2 is broken.  Download
     flex-2.5.4a, build, install.

   * The configuration of Gcc (egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1
     release)) does not include `/usr/pkg' paths.  Configure using:

          CFLAGS='-I /usr/pkg/include' LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib' ./configure


Solaris:
--------

   * Sparc64/Solaris 2.6, GNU make-3.77

     GNU make-3.77 is buggy on this platform, upgrade to 3.78.1 or
     newer.

   * Sparc64/Solaris 2.6, ld

     Not yet resolved.

AIX
---

   * AIX 4.3 ld

     The following is from the gcc install/SPECIFIC file.
             Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a
          relocation    overflow severe error when the -bbigtoc option
          is used to link    GCC-produced object files into an
          executable that overflows the TOC.     A fix for APAR IX75823
          (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND    -BBIGTOC) is
          available from IBM Customer Support and from its
          27service.boulder.ibm.com website as PTF U455193.

          Binutils does not support AIX 4.3 (at least through release
          2.9). GNU    as and GNU ld will not work properly and one
          should not configure GCC    to use those GNU utilities. Use
          the native AIX tools which do    interoperate with GCC.

     add -Wl,-bbigtoc to USER_LDFLAGS, ie:
              LDFLAGS='-Wl,-bbigtoc' ./configure
